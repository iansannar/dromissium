# General Rules

## Round Down

Whenever you divide a number, round down, regardless how close the fractional value is to the nearest integer.

## Specific Overrides General

Many rules are presented as general assumptions about how the game will proceed, and are contradicted by other rules specific to a situation, spell, ability, etc. In these situations, the specific rule takes priority.

## The Storyteller Has The Last Word

While these rules are intended to be followed as written, the Storyteller has the authority to modify or reinterpret any of them. Storytellers, beware; unfair modifications can drain the fun out of an entire game.
