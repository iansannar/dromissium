# Introduction

## Storytelling

_Dromissium_ is a roleplaying game, or in simpler terms, a shared storytelling game. Each player creates a character, which they pretend to be as they explore and adventure in the fictional world within the game. One character, the storyteller, instead acts as a referee and judge, creating challenges and adventures for the other players to enjoy.

While the storyteller does act as a referee, _Dromissium_ uses dice to help determine the consequences of actions. Does the guard believe you when you claim you weren't stealing? Were you quiet enough to not be noticed by the sleeping pack of goblins? Can you outrun an enraged giant? Dice provide both the players and the storyteller with a simple way to introduce chance, luck, and risk into the shared narrative. Read the rules about dice and what they do [here](game-rules/success-and-failure.md).

_Dromissium_ and many other roleplaying games follow this general cycle during gameplay:

1. The storyteller describes the environment and situation.
2. The players decide what their characters will say and do.
3. The storyteller narrates the results and consequences of the character's actions.

These steps are the absolute minimum for the game to function, and can be built upon. The storyteller might use drawings, music, or miniatures to help illustrate the environment and situation. The players might use different voices to act out their character. There is no limit, as long as everyone has fun.

## General Rules

Here are some general rules to keep in mind while playing the game:

### Specific Overrides General

Many rules are presented as general assumptions about how the game will run, and are contradicted by other rules specific to a situation, condition, ability, etc. In situations where two rules conflict, the specific rule takes priority over the more general rule.

### Round Down

Whenever you divide a number and end up with a fraction, round down, regardless how big the fraction is.

### The Storyteller Has the Last Word

While these rules are intended to be followed as written, the storyteller has the authority to modify or interpret any of them.

Storytellers, beware; unfair or excessive modifications to the rules can make players feel helpless, draining the fun out of the entire game.
