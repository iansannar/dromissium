# Creating a Race

## Point-Buy Custom Race

_Dromissium_ provides a point-buy system to help build balanced homebrew races.

You have 100 points to spend on racial traits. Some traits are free by default and have no price, and others are negative traits that instead give you additional points to spend elsewhere. Traits will have the amount of points they cost in parentheses next to their name.

This list is not comprehensive, but covers many common racial traits. When creating a new racial trait, use the traits here as a reference for point cost in order to keep your custom trait balanced.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is okay to not use all 100 points, but using more than 100 points will likely end up in a non-balanced race that has the potential to make the game less fun for other players.
{% endhint %}

### Nature & Type

Each creature requires a nature and a creature type. Creature type is mainly for classification, but nature does provide a racial trait.

{% hint style="info" %}
Nature is a unique part of _Dromissium_'s magic system. Not all settings require their use. In such cases, nature can be completely omitted from the game.
