# Creating an Origin

Origins are fairly flexible. Since they only modify proficiencies that are available to every player, an origin can be freely customized as long as the storyteller reviews and approves the custom background. However, there are a few guidelines that are wise to follow:

* The list of proficiencies should contain no more than a combined total of 15 skills, armor proficiencies, weapon proficiencies, and tool proficiencies.
* More than half of the skills in the list of proficiencies should be active skills.
