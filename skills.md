# Skills

Skills are divided into two categories: active skills and reactive skills. Active skills, such as Mechanics and Medicine, are employed when "actively" attempting a task, where reactive skills, such as Evasion and Insight, are used to "react" to the actions of others through contests. All skills fall under one of the six ability scores: Strength, Agility, Vitality, Erudition, Intuition, and Presence.

## Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's talent and proficiency with a certain skill or tool. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Any check made without an applicable aptitude are `2d20▼` by default. Checks made with aptitude are `1d20` by default. Aptitude can be easily denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a dot such as ⚫ next to the applicable item.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* **Armor:** light, medium, and heavy armor cannot be worn without aptitude.
* **Language:** a language cannot be understood in any way without aptitude.
* **Magic:** many spells are less reliable without aptitude.

## Mastery

Sometimes, a creature has expert command with a skill. This is represented by upgrading aptitude into mastery. Checks made with mastery are `2d20▲` by default. Mastery can easily be denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a star instead of a dot next to the applicable item, such as ⭐.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* **Armor:** Mastery with light, medium, and heavy armor removes some of the drawbacks of wearing armor.
* **Language:** Mastery in a language might provide dominance in specific situations with the approval of the Storyteller, such as mimicking a different dialect or accent, or penning a letter asking for help from the king.
* **Magic:** many spells are more reliable or effective with mastery.
