# Playing the Game

## Resting

All characters need some form of rest in order to heal and recover. Some abilities require a rest before they can be used again.

### Long Rest

A long rest occurs after 8 hours of sleep and a meal. At the end of a long rest, a creature regains all expended mana. If a creature goes 24 hours without a long rest, it must succeed a difficulty 20 Resist Exhaustion check or gain one level of Exhaustion.

### Short Rest

A short rest occurs after 4 hours of light activity or rest and a drink. At the end of a short rest, a creature regains 1 expended mana. If a creature goes three days without a short rest, it must succeed a difficulty 20 Resist Exhaustion check or gain level of Exhaustion.

## Traveling

A group can travel by foot for up to 6 hours each day at one of the following paces:

| Pace | Speed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hasty | 6 miles per hour | Threat on Observation and Stealth checks |
| Normal | 4 miles per hour | Threat on Stealth checks |
| Cautious | 2 miles per hour | — |

### Difficult Terrain

Not all travel is through flat or solid ground. When traveling through more hazardous terrain such as a swamp, snowy mountain peaks, or a dense jungle, the speed of traveling is halved.

### Travel by Flight

If a group of characters all have a flying speed, an additional travel pace becomes available to them. A group can only travel at this pace for 1 hour each day.

| Pace | Speed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Flying | 25 miles per hour | Automatically fail Stealth checks; threat on Observation checks |

### Forced March

A group of characters can travel for more than 6 hours in a day, but at the risk of straining themselves. At the beginning of each hour traveled past 6, each member of the group must succeed a Stamina check or gain one level of Exhaustion. The difficulty of this check is equal to 10 + 1 for each hour traveled past 6.

## Environment

### Fall Damage

When a creature falls from a hazardous height, it receives 1 wound for every 15 feet it fell, and must succeed on a Reflex check with difficulty equal to the distance it fell in feet or become prone.

### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of seconds equal to 120 + its Vitality score × 5. When a creature runs out of breath, it immediately begins Dying until it reaches air.

In combat, there isn't always time to take a breath before suffocation begins. In combat, a creature can only hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 2 + half its Vitality score.
