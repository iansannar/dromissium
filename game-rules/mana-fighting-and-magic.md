# Mana, Fighting, & Magic

## Mana <a id="mana"></a>

Mana represents the determination and fighting spirit of a character. Mana can be used to cast magic spells or execute daring martial feats.

Mana comes in different strengths, called mana levels. Mana can have levels 1 through 9, These are unrelated to character level directly, though a character's level does determine how strong their mana is, as well as the quantity. More powerful mana can be used to cast greater spells or stronger fighting techniques.

## Damage Types

Damage is a numerical representation of life-threatening force. There are many types of damage, used to specify what kind of danger they represent. These types have no rules of their own, but rules such as Defense and Soak rely on them. Damage types are also divided into three categories: mundane, elemental, and exotic. These categories also have no inherent rules, but assist other game mechanics by existing. Each damage type has a symbol, by which it can be referred to for short. 

| Damage Type | Symbol | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Battering | ðŸ’¢ | Mundane | Blunt force, such as a falling rock or shock wave inflicts battering damage. |
| Caustic | ðŸ§ª | Elemental | Strong acids and alkalines that corrode flesh and metal inflict caustic damage. |
| Cold | ðŸ§Š | Elemental | Frigid temperatures, such as a blizzard or the ocean inflict cold damage. |
| Electric | âš¡ | Elemental | Powerful electric force, such as being struck by lightning inflict electric damage. |
| Fire | ðŸ”¥ | Elemental | High thermals, such as the inside of a volcano or a forest fire inflict fire damage. |
| Psychic | ðŸ§  | Exotic | Mental strain, such as embarrassment or terror inflict psychic damage. |
| Radiant | ðŸŒŸ | Exotic | Powerful light, such as exposure to a star or the wrath of a god inflict radiant damage. |
| Toxic | ðŸ¦  | Elemental | Harmful substances, such as venom or poison gas inflict toxic damage. |
| Withering | ðŸ’€ | Exotic | Chaotic and entropic effects, such as antimatter or life-draining spells inflict withering damage. |
| Wounding | ðŸ©¸ | Mundane | Things that puncture, impale, cut, and slash all inflict wounding damage. |

## Defense & Soak

Defense and Soak are both ways to represent resistance against certain damage types. Defense and Soak both will specify what damage types the apply to. Defense is a damage threshold; damage that does not exceed Defense is ignored. Soak is damage reduction; damage that exceeds Defense is reduced by Soak.

If multiple sources provide Defense or Soak for the same damage type, they do not add. Use the highest Defense or Soak available. 

## Strain & Wounds

### Strain

Strain represents the negative effects of being hit by an attack that aren't threatening wounds. When an attack hits but the damage fails to exceed the target's Defense, the target instead receives strain. Strain imposes threat on the target's next check, the dice type of which is determined by the damage of the attack inflicting the strain.

| Damage | Strain |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5+ | 1d12 |

### Wounds

Wounds are a bit more serious, and represent life-threatening physical or mental injury. When a creature recieves an amount of wounds equal to its Vitality score \(minimum of 1\), it begins Dying. If it is already Dying and it recieves an amount of wounds equal to its Vitality score, the creature dies.

Wounds last until they are healed. Certain magics can achieve this instantly, but most wounds require time to heal. Each long rest, make a difficulty 15 Fortitude check for each wound. On a success, the wound heals enough to continue adventuring. On a failure, the wound remains. On a failure of 5 or more, the wound begins to fester, inflicting one level of the Sick condition, which lasts until the wound is healed.

## Attack Rolls

Weapon attacks, martial techniques and offensive magics often require a special check called an attack roll. The proficiency for this check comes from the weapon or spell being used. 

1. **Make the check.** Attack rolls are contests, typically against the target's Reflex skill. A spell or technique might specify a different skill for the target to use instead. Either way, make the check and determine the winner as well as the margin of success. If the target loses the contest, the attack hits; otherwise, it misses.
2. **Determine effects.** Spells, techniques, and weapons may specify special effects, a damage type, or both. If a damage type is specified, the amount of damage is equal to the margin of success.
3. **Resolve damage.** If the attack does damage, first check to see if the damage exceeds the target's Defense for the attack's damage type. If it fails to exceed that Defense, the attack inflicts strain of a magnitude equal to the damage of the attack minus the target's Soak for the attack's damage type. If the attack does exceed that Defense, the target receives an amount of wounds equal to the damage of the attack minus the target's Soak for the attack's damage type. If this damage would kill the target, the attacker can instead choose to knock them Unconscious for 4d6 hours or until they are woken up.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some spells, techniques, or weapons may specify more than one damage type. If multiple damage types are provided, you may choose which type to use each time you make an attack roll with that spell, technique, or weapon.
