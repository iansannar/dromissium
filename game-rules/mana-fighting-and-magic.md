# Mana, Fighting, & Magic

## Damage Types

Damage is a numerical representation of life-threatening force. There are many types of damage, used to specify what kind of danger they represent. These types have no rules of their own, but rules such as Defense and Soak rely on them. Damage types are also divided into three categories: mundane, elemental, and exotic. These categories also have no inherent rules, but assist other game mechanics by existing. Each damage type has a symbol, by which it can be referred to for short. 

| Damage Type | Symbol | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Battering | ðŸ’¢ | Mundane | Blunt force, such as a falling rock or shock wave inflicts battering damage. |
| Caustic | ðŸ§ª | Elemental | Strong acids and alkalines that corrode flesh and metal inflict caustic damage. |
| Cold | ðŸ§Š | Elemental | Frigid temperatures, such as a blizzard or the ocean inflict cold damage. |
| Electric | âš¡ | Elemental | Powerful electric force, such as being struck by lightning inflict electric damage. |
| Fire | ðŸ”¥ | Elemental | High thermals, such as the inside of a volcano or a forest fire inflict fire damage. |
| Psychic | ðŸ§  | Exotic | Mental strain, such as embarrassment or terror inflict psychic damage. |
| Radiant | ðŸŒŸ | Exotic | Powerful light, such as exposure to a star or the wrath of a god inflict radiant damage. |
| Toxic | ðŸ¦  | Elemental | Harmful substances, such as venom or poison gas inflict toxic damage. |
| Withering | ðŸ’€ | Exotic | Chaotic and entropic effects, such as antimatter or life-draining spells inflict withering damage. |
| Wounding | ðŸ©¸ | Mundane | Things that puncture, impale, cut, and slash all inflict wounding damage. |

## Defense & Soak

Defense and Soak are both ways to represent resistance against certain damage types. Defense and Soak both will specify what damage types the apply to. Defense is a damage threshold; damage that does not exceed Defense is ignored. Soak is damage reduction; damage that exceeds Defense is reduced by Soak.

If multiple sources provide Defense or Soak for the same damage type, they do not add. Use the highest Defense or Soak available. 

## Strain & Wounds

### Strain

Strain represents the negative effects of being hit by an attack that aren't threatening wounds. When an attack hits but the damage fails to exceed the target's Defense, the target instead receives strain. Strain imposes threat on the target's next check, the dice type of which is determined by the damage of the attack inflicting the strain.

| Damage | Strain |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5+ | 1d12 |

### Wounds

Wounds are a bit more serious, and represent life-threatening physical or mental injury. When a creature receives an amount of wounds equal to its Vitality score \(minimum of 1\), it begins Dying. If it is already Dying and it receives an amount of wounds equal to its Vitality score, the creature dies.

Wounds last until they are healed. Certain magics can achieve this instantly, but most wounds require time to heal. Each long rest, make a difficulty 15 Fortitude check for each wound. On a success, the wound heals enough to continue adventuring. On a failure, the wound remains. On a failure of 5 or more, the wound begins to fester, inflicting one level of the Sick condition, which lasts until the wound is healed.

## Attack Rolls

Weapon attacks, martial techniques and offensive magics often require a special check called an attack roll. The proficiency for this check comes from the weapon or spell being used. 

1. **Make the check.** Attack rolls are contests, typically against the target's Reflex skill. A spell or technique might specify a different skill for the target to use instead. Either way, make the check and determine the winner as well as the margin of success. If the target loses the contest, the attack hits; otherwise, it misses.
2. **Determine effects.** Spells, techniques, and weapons may specify special effects, a damage type, or both. If a damage type is specified, the amount of damage is equal to the margin of success.
3. **Resolve damage.** If the attack does damage, first check to see if the damage exceeds the target's Defense for the attack's damage type. If it fails to exceed that Defense, the attack inflicts strain of a magnitude equal to the damage of the attack minus the target's Soak for the attack's damage type. If the attack does exceed that Defense, the target receives an amount of wounds equal to the damage of the attack minus the target's Soak for the attack's damage type. If this damage would kill the target, the attacker can instead choose to knock them Unconscious for 4d6 hours or until they are woken up.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some spells, techniques, or weapons may specify more than one damage type. If multiple damage types are provided, you may choose which type to use each time you make an attack roll with that spell, technique, or weapon.
{% endhint %}

### Critical Hits

Rolling triumph when making an attack roll is called a critical hit. A critical hit ignores the target's Defense. If the target also rolls disaster as well, this is called an absolute hit. An absolute hit ignores both the target's defense and soak.

The consequence of rolling disaster on an attack roll is up to the storyteller, just like normal checks.

## Mana <a id="mana"></a>

Mana represents the determination and fighting spirit of a character. Mana can be used to cast magic spells or execute daring martial feats.

Mana comes in different strengths, called mana levels. Mana can have levels 1 through 9, These are unrelated to character level directly, though a character's level does determine how strong their mana is, as well as the quantity. More powerful mana can be used to cast greater spells or stronger gambits.

## Rules of Fighting

Fighting is a general term encompassing the various martial arts, as well as those that utilize mana. In _Dromissium_, this is done through tactics and gambits. Tactics are powerful techniques that consume mana, while gambits are simpler abilities that can be used at will.

### Proficiency

Unlike skills, tactics and gambits must first be learned before they can even be used with incompetence. If a creature does not first know a tactic or gambit, it cannot use it at all. Once a tactic or gambit is learned, however, its proficiency level can increase as normal.

Tactics and gambits have a wide range of effects, and not all of them require checks. Many tactics and gambits will provide their own rules for how to handle proficiency with them. In addition, many tactics and gambits employ the use of a weapon, with which you may also have proficiency. If a tactic or gambit requires an attack roll, your proficiency for that attack roll is the proficiency of the weapon used, not the tactic or gambit itself.

## Rules of Magic

Magic is the art of using mana to alter reality. In _Dromissium_, this is done through spells and tricks. Spells are powerful magic that consume mana, while tricks are simpler and smaller magical abilities that can be used at will.

### Proficiency

Unlike skills, spells and tricks must first be learned before they can even be cast with incompetence. If a creature does not first know a spell or trick, it cannot cast it at all. Once a spell or trick is learned, however, its proficiency level can increase as normal.

Spells and tricks have a wide range of effects, and not all of them require checks. Many spells and tricks will provide their own rules for how to handle proficiency with them.

### Spell Class

Spells are divided into four classes, each denoting the complexity of the magic involved in casting each spell. While anything is possible with magic, effects based on the laws of nature are much easier to produce than those manifested by pure willpower.

* **Natural magic** is the simplest form of magic. Natural spells either amplify existing and natural effects, such as turning a rainstorm into a thunderstorm, or produce naturally-occurring phenomena such as cooling water, turning it to ice. Natural spells are not permanent, and their effects end once the magic is finished.
* **Synthetic magic** produces unnatural and otherwise impossible effects temporarily, such as creating fire out of thin air or making someone fall in love with you... for a time. Synthetic magic is inherently temporary, and the natural order of things will reassert themselves once the magic is spent.
* **Persistent magic** bends existing natural forces and phenomena permanently. For example, like natural magic, persistent magic can freeze water into ice, but the ice will never thaw without magical help. Persistent magic includes many of the most powerful spells, but is limited by the laws and logic of reality.
* **True magic** is the most powerful form of magic, and is totally unrestricted. True magic can create any effect, natural or unnatural, permanently. The effects of true magic can only be undone by other magic, showing that true magic itself is a natural force governing reality. Whatever is done by true magic simply is.

Creatures are only capable of handling magic of a class proportional to their own strength. Below is a table showing the maximum number of spells a creature may know of each class depending on their level.

| Level | Synthetic magic | Persistent magic | True magic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1â€“5 | 3 spells | 2 spells | 1 spell |
| 6â€“10 | No limit | 3 spells | 2 spells |
| 11â€“15 | No limit | No limit | 3 spells |
| 16â€“20 | No limit | No limit | No limit |

### Arcane Focus

An arcane focus is a special item crafted for the purpose of channeling magical energies. This can take many forms, such as a cleric's holy symbol or a magic wand. These powerful items make casting magic a much safer ordeal. Without an arcane focus, the only way to cast magic is through either ritual casting or sacrificial casting.

#### Ritual Casting

Ritual casting ****is an old form of magic, a process by which spells can be cast through stray spirits and other magical creatures. Rituals are typically a form of offering, to which these lesser creatures will answer and act as an arcane focus in exchange for the offering. Ritual casting can also be interpreted as a petition to a higher power, who lends their strength in exchange for the offering. Some spells will list if they can be cast as a ritual, as well as how much time the ritual takes and what components are required to cast it as a ritual. Provided all these requirements are met, the spell can be cast as a ritual without expending mana and without an arcane focus.

#### Sacrificial Casting

Sacrificial casting is a dangerous gamble, by which spells are fueled by the caster's own flesh and life-force. To cast a spell sacrificially, you first cast it without expending mana, and then receive an amount of wounds equal to the level of mana you are substituting for. You do not need an arcane focus when casting sacrificially.

### Spell Components

Many spells require additional components in order to cast them. There are three kinds of components a spell could require: vocal, somatic, or material.

Vocal components are words, chants, prayers, or songs that invoke the spell. A spell that requires vocal components can only be cast if you can speak.

Somatic components are gestures that invoke the spell, which can range from small hand movements to a ritual dance. A spell that requires somatic components can only be cast if your hands are free.

Material components are physical objects that take part in the casting of a spell. Material components listed with an asterisk \(\*\) are consumed by the spell upon casting. Material components with an obelus \(â€ \) are required to cast the spell as a ritual, and are consumed upon completion of the ritual.

### Concentration

Some spells require sustained focus in order to maintain their effects called concentration. You can only concentrate on one spell at once, so if you are concentrating on a spell and cast a second spell that requires concentration, the first spell ends.

Pain or shock can break your concentration, causing the spell to fail. Whenever you are concentrating on a spell and you are hit by an attack, you must succeed on a Sanity check with a difficulty of 10 or lose concentration on the spell, ending it.
