# Ability Scores & Skills

## Ability Scores

Ability scores are four numerical values that quantify the inborn ability and talent of a character or creature. Ability scores range from -5 to +5, with the average being 0. Each ability score has a symbol, by which it can be referred to for short. 

## 💪 Vitality

Vitality represents physical toughness.

### 🎯 Agility

Agility represents physical dexterity.

### 👤 Identity

Identity represents mental toughness.

### 🎓 Wisdom

Wisdom represents mental dexterity.

## Skills

While ability scores represent the raw ability of a character or creature, skills represent specialization, focus, and experience a creature may or may not have in any certain area. All skills fall under one of the four ability scores, representing a specialization under that general ability.

### Proficiency

Proficiency is a measurement of a character's experience with a certain skill or item, and changes the reliability of checks. Three levels of proficiency exist: incompetence, aptitude, and mastery, with incompetence being the default. When a character gains proficiency with a skill or item, their proficiency increases from incompetence to aptitude, or aptitude to mastery.

| Proficiency | Checks |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incompetence | 2d20, keep lowest result |
| Aptitude | 1d20 |
| Mastery | 2d20, keep highest result |

### Tools

Sometimes, proper tools are required in order to even attempt a certain task. Tools have their own proficiency associated with them. If a task requires tools, and you don't have aptitude with those tools, you make the check with threat. If you have the tools and aptitude with them, you may make the check normally. If you have mastery with the tools, you may make the check with dominance. Read about the different tools [here]().

## List of Skills

Skills are divided into two categories: **active skills** and **reactive skills**. Active skills are generally employed when actively attempting a task, where reactive skills are generally used to react to the actions of others through checks. All skills are listed below, according to their ability score and whether they are active or reactive.

Skills can optionally be referred to by their symbols in places where writing their full names would be difficult or impractical.
