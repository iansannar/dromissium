# Introduction

Dromissium is a tabletop role-playing game framework meant to provide new players with simplicity and veterans with options. Unlike a traditional game system, Dromissium itself does not explicitly define content \(such as items, monsters, and player character options, etc.\), but rather lays a foundation of underlying rules that support balanced homebrew content.
