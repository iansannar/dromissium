Initially, Gitbook seemed like a good solution for easy editing and hosting of these rules, but over the course of 2020 they steadily moved previously free features to their paid-only service. I've been wanting to switch to a new solution for awhile, so when Gitbook changed their CDN and messed up all the DNS configurations for all of my Gitbook sites, it was just the excuse I needed to make the change. Either I let the rules be offline for a week while I try to figure out DNS settings, or I let the rules be offline for a week while I move to a new platform that pull features right out from under me every few months.

The _Remedy_ website now uses Docusaurus 2. There's still quite a bit to do, such as formatting, theming, and fixing broken links, but this is a more flexible solution for the future.
