# Creature Nature & Type

## Nature

All races of creatures fall into two categories: **terrans** and **espers**. Espers are creatures with an immortal physical essence and a mortal spirit, and terrans are those with mortal bodies but immortal souls. Each have different needs and magical abilities. A creature's **nature** is which of the following categories it falls into:

### Terran

Living in the physical world, most visible creatures are terrans. They require food and water as sustenance, and love and community to be happy. Terrans typically exchange goods and services using money, something with physical value.

When a terran dies, their physical form decomposes and returns to the elements, but their **soul** lives on, containing all their knowledge, wisdom, desires, and personality. A terran can still live on in a sense in this way. While still alive, terrans can naturally cast auramancy magic using their soul.

### Esper

Typically living in the spiritual world or in places with great significance, They require food and water to be comfortable, but do not need it to survive. Rather, their sustenance is attention; as they are loved, worshiped or hated, they are nourished. Many lesser espers can survive merely on the dreams of terrans, but those that are elevated enough to be worshiped as gods require exactly that: worship. For an esper, to be forgotten is to die. Espers typically exchange goods and services using things that have sentimental value.

When an esper dies, their spiritual form and personality dissolves into dreams. An esper's memories and desires cease to exist upon death, but a physical essence called a **promise** is left behind, containing all of the esper's strength and magical power. An esper can still influence the world after it has died in this way. While still alive, espers can naturally cast terramancy magic using their promise.

### None

In some cases, a creature might not fall into either category. These creatures are temporary, and have no eternal component. This includes constructs such as golems, or undead such as zombies.

### Half-breeds

When the bloodlines of terrans and espers mix, half-breeds are created. These creatures have some characteristics of both ancestors, but are still either terran or esper themselves. A half-breed has a greater chance to be born an esper the more espers in its familiy line, and more chance of being born a terran the more terrans in its family line.

## Type
