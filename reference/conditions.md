# Conditions

A condition lasts either until it is removed, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. Conditions may specify their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some conditions can be gained multiple times, while others cannot. If a condition does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the effect is only applied once.
