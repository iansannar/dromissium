# Conditions

A condition lasts either until it is removed, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. Conditions may specify their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some conditions can be gained multiple times, while others cannot. If a condition does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the effect is only applied once.

Conditions can optionally be referred to by their symbols in places where writing their full names would be difficult or impractical.

## ðŸ˜¡ Angry

The **Angry** condition represents extreme frustration or hatred that clouds oneâ€™s thinking.

* An Angry creature suffers threat on all Intuition-based checks.
* An Angry creature gains a +3 bonus to all Strength-based checks and damage rolls against the source of the condition.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Angry condition can be gained more than once, but only once from each source.

The **Bleeding Out** condition represents any injury that will cause death if immediate medical attention is not administered.

* If a creature that is Bleeding Out takes damage, it counts as one failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, the creature also falls Unconscious.
