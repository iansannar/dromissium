# Damage & Healing

## Damage Resistance & Vulnerability

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

### Damage Immunity

If a creature or object has immunity to a damage type, damage of that type is ignored against it.

## Damage Types

Damage types can optionally be referred to by their symbols.

| Damage Type | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `💢 battering` | mundane | Blunt force, such as a falling rock or shock wave inflicts battering damage. |
| `🧪 caustic` | elemental | Strong acids and alkalines that corrode flesh and metal inflict caustic damage. |
| `🧊 cold` | elemental | Frigid temperatures, such as a blizzard or the ocean inflict cold damage. |
| `⚡ electric` | elemental | Powerful electric force, such as being struck by lightning inflict electric damage. |
| `🔥 heat` | elemental | High thermals, such as the inside of a volcano or a forest fire inflict heat damage. |

| `🩸 wounding` | mundane | Things that puncture, impale, cut, and slash all inflict wounding damage. |
| `❌ true` | meta | True damage is a special kind of damage used by the mechanics of the game. True damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way. |

{% hint style="danger" %}
True damage should not be used in ways similar to other damage types, and exists strictly to enforce game mechanics. Weapons, spells, traps, or other in-world phenomena should never cause true damage.

## Healing Types

Healing types can optionally be referred to by their symbols.

| Healing Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `💖 healing` | Regular healing restores lost hit points. A creature cannot exceed its hit point maximum from this kind of healing. |
| `💛 temporary` | Temporary hit points act as a buffer. There is no limit to how many temporary hit points a creature can have. Temporary hit points, however, do not stack; when a creature who already has temporary hit points receives more, the amounts do not stack, and the creature must choose which amount to keep. |

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

### Instant Death
