# Status Effects

A status effect lasts either until it is removed, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the status effect. Status effects may specify their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some status effects can be gained multiple times, while others cannot. If a status effect does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the status effect has its own duration, but the effect is only applied once.

## Angry

The angry status represents extreme frustration or hatred that clouds one’s thinking.

* An angry creature suffers threat on all Intuition-based checks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The angry status can be gained more than once.
{% endhint %}

## Blinded

The blinded status represents temporary or permanent impairment to a sense. When a creature becomes blinded, the imposing effect may specify which sense it blinds \(tremorsense, blindsense, sphynxvision, truevision\), but if it does not, it is referring to vision & darkvision.

* A blinded creature automatically fails all checks that require the blinded sense. Blinded creatures also suffer threat on attack and evasion checks.
* If a creature has at least one applicable sense and that sense is not blinded, that creature may ignore the effects of being blinded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The blinded status can be gained more than once, but only if a different sense is blinded each time.
{% endhint %}

## Charmed

The charmed status represents strong but unsafe positive emotions, such as infatuation or idolization, either natural or artificially induced by magical means.

The crippled status represents severe physical impairment not representable through damage.

* A crippled creature suffers disaster on all Strength, Agility, and Vitality-based checks on a natural result of 1–2.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The crippled status can be gained more than once. If a creature has more than one level of crippled, the range for disaster increases by 1 for each level \(e.g. 4 levels of crippled triggers disaster on a natural result of 1–5\).
{% endhint %}

The deafened status represents temporary or permanent impairment to hearing.

* A deafened creature automatically fails all checks that require hearing.

While in this state, the creature is immune to toxic damage and cannot gain any other status effects. Any alterations to this rigid form remain after the petrified status is removed.
* A petrified creature cannot move, speak, or regain stamina.
* A petrified creature automatically fails evasion checks unless the attacker rolls disaster.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The petrified status can be gained up to twice. If a creature has more than one level of the petrified status, it becomes unconscious \(see the status effect\) until the petrified status ends.
{% endhint %}

## Poisoned

The poisoned status represents physical, mental, or emotional impairment due to a toxic substance.

* A poisoned creature suffers threat on checks depending on the source imposing the status. Below is a table of common poisons and which checks they impose threat on.
