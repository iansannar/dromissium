# Status Effects

A status effect lasts either until it is removed, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the status effect. Status effects may specify their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some status effects can be gained multiple times, while others cannot. If a status effect does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the status effect has its own duration, but the effect is only applied once.

Status effects can optionally be referred to by their symbols.

## 😡 Angry

The angry status represents extreme frustration or hatred that clouds one’s thinking.

* An angry creature suffers threat on all [Intuition](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#intuition)-based checks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The angry status can be gained more than once.
{% endhint %}

## 😎 Blinded

The blinded status represents temporary or permanent impairment to a sense. When a creature becomes blinded, the imposing effect may specify which sense it blinds \(tremorsense, blindsense, sphynxvision, truevision\), but if it does not, it is referring to vision & darkvision.

* A blinded creature automatically fails all checks that require the blinded sense. Blinded creatures also suffer threat on attack and evasion checks.
* If a creature has at least one applicable sense and that sense is not blinded, that creature may ignore the effects of being blinded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The blinded status can be gained more than once, but only if a different sense is blinded each time.
{% endhint %}
