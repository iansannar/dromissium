# Armor & Shields

## Armor

Not all attacks can be consistently evaded, and some sources of damage are impossible to dodge at all. Armor serves as a protection against different kinds of damage by providing Defense.

## Shields

Shields can also provide Defense, but unlike armor, they must be actively used in order to be effective. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to apply the shield's Defense against that attack.

| Shield | Vitality Minimum | Defense |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wicker Shield | -1 | +1 vs. physical |
| Wooden Shield | ±0 | +1 vs. physical, elemental |
| Metal Shield | +1 | +2 vs. physical, elemental |
| Tower Shield | +2 | +3 vs. physical, elemental |

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Incompetence <a id="incompetence"></a>

When using shields when you are incompetent with them, you must first succeed a difficulty 10 Reflex check in order to apply the shield's Defense.

#### Mastery

You may ignore the minimum vitality requirement for shields if you have mastery with them.
