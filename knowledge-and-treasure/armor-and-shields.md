# Armor & Shields

## Armor

Not all attacks can be consistently evaded, and some sources of damage are impossible to dodge at all. Armor serves as a protection against different kinds of damage by providing Defense and Soak.

## Shields

Shields can also provide Soak, but unlike armor, they must be actively used in order to be effective. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to apply the shield's Soak against that attack.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wicker Shield | -1 | 1 vs. ğŸ’¢ğŸ©¸ |
| Wooden Shield | Â±0 | 1 vs. ğŸ’¢ğŸ§ªâš¡ğŸ©¸ |
