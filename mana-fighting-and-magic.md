# Mana, Fighting & Magic

## Mana

**Mana** represents the determination and fighting spirit of a character. Mana can be used to cast magic spells or execute daring martial feats. Mana is mainly determined by level, but is influenced by a character's Presence score.

### Breaking Up Mana

Two mana of equal level can be exchanged for three mana of one level lower.

### Mana from Presence

A character's Presence score also determines an additional amount of mana that is either gained or lost, called **presence mana**. A character gains or loses mana equal to their Presence score of a level determined by the table below:

| Character Level | Mana Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1–5 | 1 |
| 6–10 | 2 |
| 11–15 | 3 |
| 16–20 | 4 |

If a character loses mana due to a negative Presence score, their mana will need to be broken up in order to subtract the proper amount of mana.

## Rules of Magic

**Magic** is the art of using mana to alter reality.
