# Mana, Fighting & Magic

## Mana

**Mana** represents the determination and fighting spirit of a character. Mana can be used to cast magic spells or execute daring martial feats. Mana is mainly determined by level, but is influenced by a character's Presence score.

Mana comes in different strengths, called **mana levels**. Mana can have levels 1 through 9, These are unrelated to character level directly, though a character's level does determine how strong their mana is. More powerful mana can be used to cast greater spells or stronger fighting techniques.

### Breaking Up Mana

Two mana of equal level can be exchanged for three mana of one level lower.

### Mana from Presence

A character's Presence score also determines an additional amount of mana that is either gained or lost, called **presence mana**. A character gains or loses mana equal to their Presence score of a level determined by the table below:

| Character Level | Mana Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1–5 | 1 |
| 6–10 | 2 |
| 11–15 | 3 |
| 16–20 | 4 |

If a character loses mana due to a negative Presence score, their mana will need to be broken up in order to subtract the proper amount of mana.

## Rules of Fighting

**Fighting** is a general term encompassing the various martial arts, as well as those that utilize mana. In _Dromissium_, this is done through **techniques** and **basic techniques**

### Technique Proficiency

Unlike skills, spells must be learned before they can even be cast with incompetence. If a creature does not **know** a spell, it cannot cast that spell.

Techniques are so diverse that it is impossible to make a general rule for how proficiency applies. A general rule does exist, but only for techniques that do not already specify how to apply incompetence and mastery. These techniques all call for some sort of check. typically a contest against the user of the technique. This Agility-based check is specific to the technique, with the proficiency coming from the technique itself. Other techniques will specify how incompetence and mastery is handled on an individual basis.

### Making an Attack

Attacks with any weapon are a special Agility-based check called an **attack roll**. Attack rolls are contests versus the target's Evade skill. Proficiency for this roll comes from proficiency with the weapon being used to make the attack.

#### Critical Hits & Misses

When making an attack roll, if you roll triumph and your opponent does not, the attack automatically hits regardless of whether you win or lose the contest. This is called a **critical hit.** When you score a critical hit, the attack's damage is doubled \(rolling twice the normal amount of dice is also acceptable\). If you score a critical hit and your opponent rolls disaster as well, you score a **total hit**. When you score a total hit, the attack's damage is multiplied by five \(rolling five times the normal amount of dice is also acceptable\).

Likewise, if you roll disaster and your opponent does not, the attack automatically misses and does no damage. This is called a **critical miss**. If you score a critical miss and your opponent rolls triumph as well, you score a **total miss** and something extra bad happens as well at the storyteller's discretion. This may include penalties such as hitting a friendly target near your intended target, or leaving yourself wide open, granting dominance on all attacks against you until your next turn.

## Rules of Magic

**Magic** is the art of using mana to alter reality. In _Dromissium_, this is done through **spells** and **tricks**. Spells are powerful magic that consume mana, while tricks are simpler and smaller magical abilities that can be used at will.

### Spell Proficiency

Unlike skills, spells must be learned before they can even be cast with incompetence. If a creature does not **know** a spell, it cannot cast that spell.

Spells are so diverse that it is impossible to make a general rule for how proficiency applies. A general rule does exist, but only for spells that do not already specify how to apply incompetence and mastery. These spells all call for some sort of check. typically a contest against the caster. This Intuition-based check is specific to the spell, with the proficiency coming from the spell itself. Other spells will specify how incompetence and mastery is handled on an individual basis.

### Spell Class

Spells are divided into four classes, each denoting the complexity of the magic involved in casting each spell. While anything is possible with magic, effects based on science are much easier to produce than those manifested by pure willpower. The spell classes are as listed:

* **Natural magic** is the simplest form of magic. Natural spells either amplify existing and natural effects, such as turning a rainstorm into a thunderstorm, or produce naturally-occurring phenomena such as cooling water, turning it to ice. Natural spells are not permanent, and their effects end once the magic is finished.
* **Synthetic magic** produces unnatural and otherwise impossible effects temporarily, such as creating fire out of thin air or making someone fall in love with you... for a time. Synthetic magic is inherently temporary, and the natural order of things will reassert themselves once the magic is spent.
* **Persistent magic** bends existing natural forces and phenomena permanently. For example, like natural magic, persistent magic can freeze water into ice, but the ice will never thaw without magical help. Persistent magic includes many of the most powerful spells, but is limited by the laws and logic of reality.
* **True magic** is the most powerful form of magic, and is totally unrestricted. True magic can create any effect, natural or unnatural, permanently. The effects of true magic can only be undone by other magic, showing that true magic itself is a natural force governing reality. Whatever is done by true magic simply is.

#### Level Restriction

Creatures are only capable of casting magic of a class proportional to their own ability. Below is a table showing the maximum number of spells a creature may know of each class depending on their level.

| Level | Synthetic magic | Persistent magic | True magic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1–5 | 3 spells | 2 spells | 1 spell |
| 6–10 | No limit | 3 spells | 2 spells |
| 11–15 | No limit | No limit | 3 spells |
| 16–20 | No limit | No limit | No limit |

### Arcane Focus

Naturally each creature can only cast one type of magic, depending on their nature: auramancy for terrans, and terramancy for espers. However, this natural ability to cast magic comes from their soul or promise, and a special kind of item called an **arcane focus** allows a creature to cast both kinds of magic. Arcane foci are specially crafted for either a terran or an esper, and contain the soul or promise of a lesser creature through which their mana is channeled.

Some greater beings lend their power, such as gods granting their followers the ability to perform miracles. These require another form of arcane focus called a **holy symbol**, which instead acts as a conduit to the higher power, through which the mana is channeled instead of an object.

If you are a terran and you don't have an arcane focus with a promise or a holy symbol, you cannot cast terramancy. Likewise, if you are an esper and you don't have an arcane focus with a soul or a holy symbol, you cannot cast auramancy.

#### Sacrificial Casting

An esper's promise and a terran's soul are eternal, which is why different kinds of magic come naturally to each kind of creature. However, it is possible for a terran to cast terramancy using its mortal flesh and for an esper to cast auramancy using its mortal psyche. This is called **sacrificial casting**. To do so, you take an amount of true damage equal to 10 times the level of mana you are substituting for. If you are reduced to 0 hit points in this way, you die.

### Spell Attacks

Some spells are offensive abilities that function very similarly to weapon attacks. Attacks with any spell are a special Intuition-based check called a **spell attack roll**. Unlike weapon attacks, however, spells specify what skill is used in the contest against that spell.

Spell attack rolls can also score critical hits and misses just like normal attacks. Read about critical hits and misses [here](mana-fighting-and-magic.md#critical-hits-and-misses).

### Ritual Casting

**Ritual casting** is the old form of magic, a process by which spells can be cast through stray spirits, celestial, fell, or fey creatures. Rituals are typically a form of offering, which these lesser creatures will answer and act as an arcane focus in exchange for the offering. Ritual casting can also be interpreted as a petition to a higher power, who lends their strength in exchange for the offering. Some spells will list if they can be cast as a ritual, as well as how much time the ritual takes and what components are required to cast it as a ritual.. Techniques are powerful martial maneuvers that consume mana, while basic techniques are simpler and more common fighting moves that can be used at will.

### Spell Components

#### Vocal

**Vocal components** are words, chants, prayers, or songs that invoke the spell. A spell that requires vocal components can only be cast if you can speak.

#### Somatic

**Somatic components** are gestures that invoke the spell, which can range from small hand movements to a ritual dance. A spell that requires somatic components can only be cast if your hands are free.

#### Material

**Material components** are physical objects that take part in the casting of a spell. Material components listed with an asterisk \(\*\) are consumed by the spell and must be provided in order to cast the spell at all. Material components with an obelus \(†\) are consumed by the spell and must be provided in order to cast the spell as a ritual.

#### Concentration

Some spells require continual focus in order to maintain. These spells require **concentration**. 

You can only concentrate on one spell at once, so if you are concentrating on a spell and cast a second spell that requires concentration, the first spell ends.

Pain or shock can break your concentration, causing the spell to fail. Whenever you are concentrating on a spell and you take damage, you must make a Resist Fear check with a difficulty equal to half the amount of hit points you are missing. If you fail, your concentration is broken and the spell ends.

### Decipher Spell

Magic can be difficult to learn, understand, or reverse. **Decipher Spell** describes a special kind of Genius-based skill used in these kinds of situations.

Decipher Spell is not listed as a skill, because aptitude and mastery for it comes from the spell asking for such a check. If you cast a spell that asks for a Decipher Spell check, your proficiency for the check is the same as the spell you are casting. Decipher spell checks are always contests, and it always targets a different spell. This is the **targeted spell**.

Each spell has a **Decipher Spell difficulty** that describes how complex the magic is. This difficulty is equal to twice the level that the targeted spell was cast at, plus an extra amount depending on the class of the targeted spell: +2 for natural magic, +4 for synthetic magic, +8 for persistent magic, and +12 for true magic.

#### Spell Improvisation

Sometimes, you may want to cast a spell you do not know or one that has not yet been invented. Such a task can require hours to years of study and research, but one with a clear idea of how to achieve the effect they want to create can attempt to **improvise** the spell, with varying degrees of success.

To cast a spell you do not know, you first expend mana of the correct level for the desired spell, then make an Arcana check with a difficulty equal to 10 + the spell's Decipher Spell difficulty. On a success, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell does not take effect, and the mana is wasted, along with any material components that would be consumed by the spell.

Once you improvise a spell in this way successfully an amount of times equal to the spell's Decipher Spell difficulty, you may learn the spell. When you learn a spell in this way, it does not use or require Training.

Tricks cannot be improvised.
