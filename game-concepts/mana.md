# Mana

Mana represents the energy and fighting spirit of a character. Mana can be used to cast magic spells or execute daring martial feats. Mana is mainly determined by level, but is influenced by one's [Presence](ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) ability score.

### Breaking Up Mana

Two mana of equal level can be exchanged for three mana of one level lower.

### Mana from Presence

A character's [Presence](ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) ability score also determines an additional amount of mana that is either gained or lost. A character gains or loses mana equal to their [Presence](ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) score of a level determined by the table below:

| Character Level | Mana Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1–5 | 1 |
| 6–10 | 2 |
| 11–15 | 3 |
| 16–20 | 4 |

If a character loses mana due to a negative [Presence](ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) score, their mana will need to be [broken up](../playing-the-game/creating-a-character/#breaking-up-mana) in order to subtract the proper amount of mana.

### Using Hit Points in place of Mana

When casting a spell or executing a technique, you can use hit points instead of using mana. To do this, you take an amount of true damage equal to 10 times the level of mana you are substituting for. If you are reduced to 0 hit points in this way, you die.
