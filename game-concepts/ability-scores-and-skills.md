# Ability Scores & Skills

Active skills, such as Mechanics and Medicine, are employed when "actively" attempting a task, where reactive skills, such as Evasion and Insight, are used to "react" to the actions of others through contests.

### Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's talent and proficiency with a certain skill or tool. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Checks made with aptitude are `1d20` by default. Aptitude can be easily denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a dot such as ⚫ next to the applicable item.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* **Language:** a language cannot be understood in any way without aptitude.
* **Magic:** many spells are [less reliable](../magic/rules-of-magic.md#applying-aptitude-and-mastery) without aptitude.

### Mastery

Sometimes, a creature has expert command with a skill. This is represented by upgrading aptitude into mastery. Checks made with mastery are `2d20▲` by default. Mastery can easily be denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a star instead of a dot next to the applicable item, such as ⭐.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* **Armor:** mastery with armor allows the wearer to [ignore some prerequisites](../equipment/untitled.md#armor).
