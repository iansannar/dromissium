# Ability Scores & Skills

## Ability Scores

**Ability scores** are six numerical values that quantify the inborn ability and talent of a character or creature.

Ability scores can optionally be referred to by their symbols in places where writing their full names would be difficult or impractical.

### 💪 Strength

**Strength** represents athleticism and physical power. Strength directly affects movement speed and physical attack damage.

### 🎯 Agility

**Agility** represents reflex and dexterity. Agility directly affects initiative and physical attack accuracy.

### 💕 Vitality

**Vitality** represents physical fortitude and health. Vitality directly affects hit points.

### 🎓 Genius

**Genius** represents knowledge and intelligence. Genius directly affects proficiencies and spell potency.

### 🤝 Instinct

**Instinct** represents gut feeling and perception. Instinct directly affects magical accuracy.

### 👤 Presence

**Presence** represents charisma and personality. Presence directly affects mana.

## Skills

While ability scores represent the raw ability of a character or creature, **skills** represent specialization, focus, and experience a creature may or may not have in any certain area. All skills fall under one of the six ability scores, representing a specialization under that general ability.

### Proficiency

**Proficiency** is a measurement of a character's experience with a certain skill, item, or language. Three levels of proficiency exist: **incompetence**, **aptitude**, and **mastery**.

#### Incompetence

The default skill proficiency level, incompetence is a reflection of a character's lack of experience or talent with a certain skill or tool. Any check made with incompetence are `2d20▼` by default.

#### Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's talent and proficiency with a certain skill or tool. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Checks made with aptitude are `1d20` by default.

Aptitude can be easily denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a dot such as ⚫ next to the applicable item.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* Armor has penalties when worn without aptitude.
* Many magical spells are less reliable without aptitude.

#### Mastery

Sometimes, a creature has expert command with a skill. This is represented by upgrading aptitude into mastery. Checks made with mastery are `2d20▲` by default.

Gaining aptitude in anything from two different sources results in mastery. Mastery can also be gained from other sources.

Mastery can easily be denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a star instead of a dot next to the applicable item, such as ⭐.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* Mastery with armor allows the wearer to ignore some prerequisites.
* Many spells are more reliable or effective with mastery.

### Tools

Sometimes, proper **tools** are required in order to even attempt a certain task. Tools have their own proficiency associated with them. If a task requires tools, and you don't have aptitude with those tools, you make the check with threat. If you have the tools and aptitude with them, you may make the check normally. If you have mastery with the tools, you may make the check with dominance. Read about the different tools [here](equipment/tools.md).
