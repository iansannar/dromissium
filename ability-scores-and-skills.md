# Ability Scores & Skills

**Ability scores** are six numerical values that quantify the inborn ability and talent of a character or creature.

Ability scores can optionally be referred to by their symbols in places where writing their full names would be difficult or impractical.

### 💪 Strength

**Strength** represents athleticism and physical power. Strength directly affects movement speed and physical attack damage.

### 🎯 Agility

**Agility** represents reflex and dexterity. Agility directly affects initiative and physical attack accuracy.

### 💕 Vitality

**Vitality** represents physical fortitude and health. Vitality directly affects hit points.

### 🎓 Erudition

**Erudition** represents knowledge and intelligence. Erudition directly affects proficiencies and spell potency.

### 🤝 Intuition

**Intuition** represents instinct and perception. Intuition directly affects magical accuracy.

### 👤 Presence

**Presence** represents charisma and personality. Presence directly affects mana.

## Skills

While ability scores represent the raw ability of a character or creature, **skills** represent specialization, focus, and experience a creature may or may not have in any certain area. All skills fall under one of the six ability scores, representing a specialization under that general ability.

### Proficiency

**Proficiency** is a measurement of a character's experience with a certain skill, item, or language. Three levels of proficiency exist: **incompetence**, **aptitude**, and **mastery**.

#### Incompetence

The default skill proficiency level, incompetence is a reflection of a character's lack of experience or talent with a certain skill or tool. Any check made with incompetence are `2d20▼` by default.

#### Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's talent and proficiency with a certain skill or tool. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Checks made with aptitude are `1d20` by default.

Aptitude can be easily denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a dot such as ⚫ next to the applicable item.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* Armor has penalties when worn without aptitude.
* A language cannot be understood without aptitude.
* Many magical spells are less reliable without aptitude.

#### Mastery

Sometimes, a creature has expert command with a skill. This is represented by upgrading aptitude into mastery. Checks made with mastery are `2d20▲` by default.

Gaining aptitude in anything from two different sources results in mastery. Mastery can also be gained from other sources.

Mastery can easily be denoted on a character sheet or stat block with a star instead of a dot next to the applicable item, such as ⭐.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the exceptions:

* Mastery with armor allows the wearer to ignore some prerequisites.
* Mastery in a language might only apply in specific situations with the approval of the storyteller, such as mimicking a different dialect or accent, or penning a proper and official letter asking for help from the king.
* Many spells are more reliable or effective with mastery.
