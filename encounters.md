# Encounters

## Initiative

Once an encounter begins, all creatures involved must roll initiative. Initiative is a temporary score that determines in what order everyone takes their turns. Initiative is determined by `1d20+ðŸ‘Œ` for each creature. Ties in initiative are resolved by making the same roll again as a contest, with the winner going first.

## Rounds & Turns

Encounters are fast-paced and chaotic. In order to manage this, time is divided into rounds and turns. A round represents about 5â€“10 seconds of in-game time. Within each round, each participant takes their turn. Turns are taken in order of highest to lowest initiative. When everybody has taken their turn, the next round begins, and the cycle begins again.

This organization of time continues until the Storyteller decides that the encounter has ended.

### Surprise

Certain circumstances may leave one side of an encounter surprised. If the Storyteller determines that an individual or group are surprised, they do not gain any stamina on their first turn \(explained below\).

### Holding a Turn

Any participant in an encounter may choose to reduce their initiative score to a minimum of 0 for the rest of the round. This decision must be declared before their turn is taken, and their original initiative score is restored at the end of their turn. If they choose the same initiative score as a different creature, they go after that creature.

## Stamina

Stamina represents how much a creature is physically capable of accomplishing within the course of a round. Each creature has a maximum stamina of 5 + Vitality.

Different things cost stamina during a round. Many actions taken during a turn require stamina, but it can also be used to react to things that happen during others' turns. A creature's stamina is replenished completely at the beginning of their turn.

## Movement

Each turn, each participant in an encounter can move up to an amount equal to their speed \(use walking, swimming, or flying speed as applicable\). If multiple kinds of movement are used during a turn, the total amount traveled must be less than or equal to the greatest speed used. Movement does not have to be continuous, and can be broken up between other actions during a turn.

You can move through space occupied by another creature, but you cannot end your movement in a space occupied by another creature. In addition, spaces occupied by hostile creatures count as difficult terrain.

### Difficult Terrain

Some terrain is more difficult to move through than others. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. Some kinds of difficult terrain may be ignored by certain speeds, such as flying over briers or swimming through water rather than wading. The Storyteller decides what kinds of terrain are difficult, and what movement types are affected.
