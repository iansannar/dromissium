# Part 1: Rules

## Core Concepts

### Dice

The game uses several kinds of polyhedral dice. Sets of these can be found both in game stores as well as online. Computer programs, websites, and other tools can be used in lieu of phsyical dice as well. The following kids of dice are used:

- The 20-sided die, or **d20**. This is the most commonly used die in the game, used to resolve events, determining success or failure.

- The 12-sided die, or **d12**.

- The 10-sided die, or **d10**. This die works a bit differently. It is numbered 0-9, but a 0 is treated as 10. Numbers between 1 and 100 can be generated using a pair of these, also known as percentile dice, or **d%**. One of the pair is multiplied by ten, and then they are added together, with a 0 being treated as 100. Some d10s are specially marked to be used in this way, displaying multiples of ten.

- The 8-sided die, or **d8**.

- The 6-sided die, or **d6**.

- The 4-sided die, or **d4**.

When dice are used, the rules specify how many dice, what kind of dice, and other information. For example, **3d6+7** would mean rolling three six-sided dice, adding their results together, and adding 7 to the total. Sometimes, special symbols will appear to indicate special information about a roll. For example, **2d6🔥** would indicate 2d6 fire damage, and **2d20↾** would indicate keeping the highest result out of the two twenty-sided dice. Here are all such symbols:

- **↾** Advantage: the highest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored.

- **⇂** Disadvantage: the lowest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored.

- **!** Exploding: if the result of a die is the maximum number, (e.g., a result of 6 on a d6), the dice is rerolled and added to the total. This may be repeated as long as the result is the maximum number.

- **↻** Lucky: if the result of a die is the minimum number, (e.g., a result of 1 on a d8), the dice may be rerolled once. The new result must be used.

- 🧪 Acid: indicates acid damage type.

- ❄️ Cold: indicates cold damage type.

- 💢 Battering: indicates battering damage type.

- ⚡ Electric: indicates electric damage type.

- 🔥 Fire: indicates fire damage type.

- 🧠 Psychic: indicates psychic damage type.

- 🌟 Radiant: indicates radiant damage type.

- ☣️ Toxic: indicates toxic damage type.

- ☠️ Withering: indicates withering damage type.

- 🩸 Wounding: indicates wounding damage type.

#### Dominance & Threat

Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelyhood of success, such attempting to enter a guarded castle while having a good reputation or trying to barter prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Dominance adds a bonus d6 to a roll, relfecting a positive circumstance, while threat is the opposite: a penalty d6 that is subtracted from a roll. If you have both dominance and threat, they cancel out—however, both dominance and threat stack. Trying to hit a target while being blind, drunk, and set on fire, but having a magic target-seeking arrow might warrant three threats and one dominance, ultimately resulting in just two threats applied to the roll.
