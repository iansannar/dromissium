# What Makes a Character

## Ability Scores

Each character has six ability scores that quantify inborn ability and talent. You can read about ability scores [here](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#ability-scores). These ability scores can be generated in two ways:

* Dice: Ability scores can be generated randomly by rolling `2d4▲-1d4` six times, and assigning each result to the ability score of your choice.
* Standard Array: The array +2, +2, +1, +1, ±0, -1 can be used, assigning each value to an ability score of your choice.

## Race

Each character has a race, which defines their natural characteristics. Choose a race for your character. Read about the options for your character's race [here](race.md#character-races).

## Origin

Each character has an origin, which describes their background knowledge and experience prior to adventuring. Read about the options for your character's origin [here](origin.md#character-origins).

## Traits

**Traits** are an optional resource when creating a character that help better describe the character both in roleplay as well as rule-wise. If you would like to use traits, you can read about the options [here](traits.md).

## Hit Points

Each character has **hit points**, a number representing their current health. This is further broken down into **maximum hit points** and **current hit points**.

At 1st level, your maximum hit points is equal to the highest number on your constitution die + your Vitality score.

## Mana

Each creature has mana, a resource that represents determination and fighting spirit. Mana is mainly determined by your level, but is influenced by your Presence score as well. At level 1, you have two mana of level 2. Read about gaining or losing presence mana [here](../mana-fighting-and-magic.md#mana-from-presence).

## Training

**Training** are points that represent the practice and experience you have with either magic or fighting. At level 1, you have 4 training.

Each technique you know counts 2 towards your Training, and each spell you know counts towards your Training, depending on the spell's class: 1 for natural magic, 2 for synthetic magic, 3 for persistent magic, and 4 for true magic.

You also have a separate Training specifically for Tricks and Basic Techniques called **Basic Training** equal to half your level plus your Genius score \(minimum of 1\).

You may learn new spells and techniques as long as you do not exceed your Training.

## Beyond Level 1

After some time adventuring, developing, and training, the storyteller may decide it is time for you to level up. Below is a table outlining the benefits you recieve as you gain levels, after which are more thorough descriptions for each of those benefits.

In addition, every time you gain a level, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your Vitality score + the result of one constitution die.
