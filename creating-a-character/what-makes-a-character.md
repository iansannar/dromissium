# What Makes a Character

## Ability Scores

Each character has six ability scores that quantify inborn ability and talent. You can read about ability scores [here](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#ability-scores). These ability scores can be generated in two ways:

* Dice: Ability scores can be generated randomly by rolling `2d4▲-1d4` six times, and assigning each result to the ability score of your choice.
* Standard Array: The array +2, +2, +1, +1, ±0, -1 can be used, assigning each value to an ability score of your choice.

## Race

Each character has a **race**, which defines their natural characteristics. Choose a race for your character. Read about the options for your character's race [here](race.md#character-races).

## Origin

Each character has an **origin**, which describes their background knowledge and experience prior to adventuring. Read about the options for your character's origin [here](origin.md#character-origins).
