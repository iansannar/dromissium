# Traits

**Traits** are an optional resource when creating a character, and are divided into two types: **beneficial traits** and **detrimental traits**. You may add as many beneficial traits as you like to your character, but for every beneficial trait you choose to add you must also add a detrimental trait.

## Beneficial Traits

## Detrimental Traits

### Old

Your character is reaching the close of their lifespan. Your Vitality score is reduced by 1, but you gain aptitude in the Insight and Persuasion skills.
