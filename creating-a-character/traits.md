# Traits

**Traits** are an optional resource when creating a character, and are divided into three types: **beneficial traits**, **detrimental traits**, and **neutral traits**. You may add as many beneficial traits as you like to your character, but for every beneficial trait you choose to add you must also add a detrimental trait. You can add as many neutral traits as you like, as each has both benefits and drawbacks.

## Beneficial Traits

## Detrimental Traits

### Old

Your character is reaching the close of their lifespan. Your Vitality score is reduced by 1, but you gain aptitude in the Insight and Persuasion skills.

## Neutral Traits

### Blind

You were born blind. You lose any senses gained from your race. However, you gain dominance on all Perception checks that use hearing or smell.
