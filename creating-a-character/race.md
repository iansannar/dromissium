# Race

## Racial Traits

Each character has a **race**, which defines their natural, inborn characteristics. The benefits gained from these characteristics are called **racial traits**. The following racial traits are present in each race. A short description explains what they mean:

### Nature, Type, & Subrace

Each race has a **nature** and a **creature type**. Both can be read about [here](../reference/creature-nature-and-type.md). Some races may also have different **subraces** to choose from to further specialize your character's race. Nature and creature type are found underneath the race's name without any further description, and subraces are listed at the end of the race's general racial traits.

### Constitution

**Constitution** represents the recovery capabilities of a creature. Constitution is a type of dice, usually a d8, d10, or d12. These dice affect how many hit points can be recovered when resting, as well as the potential amount of maximum hit points gained when leveling up. Each player has a maximum amount of constitution dice equal to their level.

Each race defines which type of dice it uses for constitution.

### Senses

Each race sees the world in some way, whether it is by light, by sound, or by magic. Each race will list what **senses** they have and their ranges. Read about the different kinds of senses [here](../reference/senses.md).

### Walk, Climb, & Swim Speeds

Each creature has a **walking speed**, a **climbing speed**, and a **swimming speed**. These speeds represent how fast a creature can move across different kinds of terrain both while traveling and during encounters. Some creatures may have a **flying speed** as well, though this is more rare.

A creature's base movement speed is equal to 5 Ã— their Strength score, but a creature's race provides different bonuses that are added to each different kind of movement speed.

### Ability Score Increase

All races are different, and many of them have natural advantages or disadvantages compared to others. Each race will specify which ability scores to increase, and by how much.

### Other Racial Traits

Races usually have additional traits. These are listed below the rest of the traits with a thorough description of what they do.

## Rarity

Not all races are found everywhere, and as such not all races are suited for all settings. Each race has a rarity, which might restrict its availability. **Racial rarities** are listed below:

* âšª Common. No restrictions.
* ðŸŸ¢ Uncommon. No restrictions. Try to avoid having more than one or two of this race in a group at a time.
* ðŸ”µ Rare. Ask your storyteller before creating a character with this race. They will probably say yes.
* ðŸŸ£ Exotic. Ask your storyteller before creating a character with this race. In addition, try to avoid having more than one of this race in a group at a time.
* ðŸŸ  Prime. These races are incredibly rare or powerful. It is wise to avoid using them at all.
* ðŸ”´ Unique. Player-made races have this rarity. Before making a race, obtain the storyteller's permission to make a custom race, and have them review and approve your custom race before using it. Read about homebrew races [here](../homebrew/creating-a-race.md).
