# Origin

## Origin Proficiency

Each character has an **origin**, which describes their background knowledge and experience prior to adventuring. Each origin provides a short description, as well as a list of possible proficiencies. A character gains an amount of proficiencies from their origin's list equal to 3 + their Erudition score. When a character's Erudition score increases or decreases, the amount of aptitudes they gain from their origin changes to reflect the new score.
