# Rules of Magic

## Spell Class

Spells are divided into four classes, each denoting the complexity of the magic involved in casting each spell. While anything is possible with magic, effects based on science are much easier to produce than those manifested by pure willpower. The spell classes are as listed:

* **Natural magic** is the simplest form of magic. Natural spells either amplify existing and natural effects, such as turning a rainstorm into a thunderstorm, or produce naturally-occurring phenomena such as cooling water, turning it to ice. Natural spells are not permanent, and their effects end once the magic is finished.
* **Synthetic magic** produces unnatural and otherwise impossible effects temporarily, such as creating fire out of thin air or making someone fall in love with you... for a time. Synthetic magic is inherently temporary, and the natural order of things will reassert themselves once the magic is spent.
* **Persistent magic** bends existing natural forces and phenomena permanently. For example, like natural magic, persistent magic can freeze water into ice, but the ice will never thaw without magical help. Persistent magic includes many of the most powerful spells, but is limited by the laws and logic of reality.
* **True magic** is the most powerful form of magic, and is totally unrestricted. True magic can create any effect, natural or unnatural, permanently. The effects of true magic can only be undone by other magic, showing that true magic itself is a natural force governing reality. Whatever is done by true magic simply is.

### Level Restriction

Creatures are only capable of casting magic of a class proportional to their own ability. Below is a table showing the maximum number of spells a creature may know of each class depending on their level.

| Level | Synthetic magic | Persistent magic | True magic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1â€“5 | 3 spells | 2 spells | 1 spell |
| 6â€“10 | No limit | 3 spells | 2 spells |
| 11â€“15 | No limit | No limit | 3 spells |
| 16â€“20 | No limit | No limit | No limit |

## Components

### Vocal

### Somatic

### Material

Material components are physical objects that must be used as part of a spell's casting.

#### Arcane Focus

An [arcane focus](../equipment/special-items.md#arcane-focus) is a magical item \(such as a wand or crystal ball\) that can substitute material components that do not specify a cost and are not consumed by the spell. Arcane foci are made specifically for the purpose of focusing magical energies and require skill to construct.

Material components with an asterisk \(\*\) are consumed by the spell and must be provided even with an arcane focus. Material components with an obelus \(â€ \) are not consumed by the spell, but must be provided even with an arcane focus.

## Concentration

## Spell Proficiency

### Gaining Aptitude

### Applying Aptitude & Mastery

Spells are so diverse that it is hard to make a general rule for how [proficiency](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#proficiency) applies. Many spells will specify how [ineptitude](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#incompetence) and [mastery](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#mastery) is handled on an individual basis.

A general rule does exist, but only for spells that do not already specify how to apply [ineptitude](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#incompetence) and [mastery](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#mastery). These spells all call for some sort of check. typically a contest. This [Intuition](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#intuition)-based check is specific to the spell \(`1d20+ðŸ‘‚`\). Normal rules for [proficiency](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#proficiency) apply to these checks. with the proficiency being with the spell itself.

## Spell Tolerance

Magic can be difficult to learn, understand, or reverse. Spell Tolerance describes a special kind of [Erudition](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#erudition)-based check used in these kinds of situations.

Spell Tolerance is not listed as a skill, because aptitude and mastery for it comes from the spell asking for such a check. If you cast a spell that asks for a Spell Tolerance check, your [proficiency](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#proficiency) for the check is the same as the spell being cast.

The [DC](../game-concepts/success-and-failure.md#difficulty-class) of a Spell Tolerance check is equal to twice the level of the spell \(or whatever level that spell was cast at\), plus an extra amount depending on the class of the magical effect: `+2` for natural magic, `+4` for synthetic magic, `+8` for persistent magic, and `+12` for true magic.

## Spell Improvisation

Sometimes, one desires to cast a spell they do not know or has not yet been invented. Such a task can require hours to years of study and research, but one with a clear idea of the effect they want to create can attempt to improvise the spell, with varying degrees of success.

To cast a spell you do not know, you first expend [mana](rules-of-magic.md#mana) of the correct level for the desired spell, then make an [ðŸ”® Arcana](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#arcana) check with a DC equal to `10` + the spell's [Spell Tolerance DC](rules-of-magic.md#spell-tolerance). On a success, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell does not take effect, and your [mana](rules-of-magic.md#mana) is wasted, along with any [material components](rules-of-magic.md#material) that would be consumed by the spell.

Once you improvise a spell in this way successfully an amount of times equal to the spell's [Spell Tolerance DC](rules-of-magic.md#spell-tolerance), you may learn the spell. When you learn a spell in this way, it does not use or require [Training](../playing-the-game/creating-a-character/#training).

Tricks cannot be improvised.
