# Rules of Magic

## Spell Class

Spells are divided into four classes, each denoting the complexity of the magic involved in casting each spell. While anything is possible with magic, effects based on science are much easier to produce than those manifested by pure willpower. The spell classes are as listed:

* **Î´ class magic** is the simplest form of magic. Î´ class spells either amplify existing and natural effects, such as turning a rainstorm into a thunderstorm, or produce naturally-occurring phenomena such as cooling water, turning it to ice. Î´ class spells are not permanent.
* **Î³ class magic** produces unnatural and otherwise impossible effects temporarily, such as creating gold out of thin air or making someone fall in love with you... for a time. Î³ class magic is inherently temporary, and the natural order of things will reassert themselves once the magic is spent.
* **Î² class magic** bends existing natural forces and phenomena permanently. For example, like Î´ class magic, Î² class magic can freeze water into ice, but the ice will never thaw without magical help. Î² class magic includes many of the most powerful spells, but is limited by the laws and logic of reality.
* **Î± class magic** is the most powerful form of magic, and is totally unrestricted. Î± class magic can create any effect, natural or unnatural, permanently. The effects of Î± class magic can only be undone by other magic, showing that it itself is a natural force governing reality. Whatever is done by Î± class magic simply is.

## Spell Capacity

Provided you are able to cast magic, you have a Spell Capacity equal to three times your level. Each spell you know counts towards your Spell Capacity: 1 for Î´ class, 2 for Î³ class, 3 for Î² class, and 4 for Î± class. You may learn new spells as long as you do not exceed your Spell Capacity.

You also have a separate Trick Capacity specifically for Tricks equal to twice your level.

## Components

### Vocal

### Somatic

### Material

Material components with an asterisk \(\*\) are consumed by the spell and must be provided.

## Spell Proficiency

### Gaining Aptitude

### Applying Aptitude & Mastery

Spells are so diverse that it is hard to make a general rule for how [proficiency](../skills.md#proficiency) applies. Many spells will specify how [incompetence](../skills.md#incompetence) and [mastery](../skills.md#mastery) is handled on an individual basis.

A general rule does exist, but only for spells that do not already specify how to apply [incompetence](../skills.md#incompetence) and [mastery](../skills.md#mastery). These spells all call for some sort of check. typically a contest. This Intuition-based check is specific to the spell \(`d20+ðŸ‘‚`\). Normal rules for [proficiency](../skills.md#proficiency) apply to these checks.

## Spell Tolerance

Magic can be difficult to learn, understand, or reverse. Spell Tolerance describes a special kind of Erudition-based check used in these kinds of situations.

Spell Tolerance is not listed as a skill, because aptitude and mastery for it comes from the spell asking for such a check. If you cast a spell that asks for a Spell Tolerance check, your [proficiency](../skills.md#proficiency) for the check is the same as the spell being cast.

The DC of a Spell Tolerance check is equal to twice the level of the spell \(or whatever level that spell was cast at\), plus an extra amount depending on the class of the magical effect: +0 for Î´ class, +2 for Î³ class, +4 for Î² class, and +8 for Î± class.

## Spell Improvisation

Sometimes, one desires to cast a spell they do not know or has not yet been invented. Such a task can require hours to years of study and research, but one with a clear idea of the effect they want to create can attempt to improvise the spell, with varying degrees of success.

To cast a spell you do not know, you first expend mana of the correct level for the desired spell, then make a [Spell Tolerance](rules-of-magic.md#spell-tolerance) check. On a success, you cast the spell normally \([without aptitude](../skills.md#incompetence)\). On a failure, the spell does not take effect, and your mana is wasted, along with any material components that would be consumed by the spell.

Once you improvise a spell in this way successfully an amount of times equal to the spell's [Spell Tolerance DC](rules-of-magic.md#spell-tolerance), you may learn the spell, provided you have enough Spell Capacity to do so. If doing so would exceed your [Spell Capacity](rules-of-magic.md#spell-capacity), you can immediately learn the spell as soon as you have enough [Spell Capacity](rules-of-magic.md#spell-capacity) to do so.

Tricks cannot be improvised.
