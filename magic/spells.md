## Attract/Repel

_Persistent Auramancy \(Level 8\)_  
**Components** V, S, M \(a spoonful of honey\*, a piece of wool soaked in vinegar\*\)  
**Casting Time** 1 hour  
**Range** 60 feet  
**Duration** 10 days

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either an object, creature, or area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of creature. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose whether the aura attracts or repels the specified creatures when you cast this spell.

When a creature of the kind you specified enters an area within 60 feet of the target or can see it, the creature feels an intense urge to either approach the target or flee from it, depending on which effect you chose. It must succeed a [😈 Resist Enchantment](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#resist-enchantment) check or be affected by the aura.

### Attraction

An affected creature cannot willingly move further away from the target, and must use movement on each of its turns to move closer to the target.

### Repulsion

An affected creature cannot willingly move closer to the target, and must use movement on each of its turns to move away from the target.

If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, or the creature takes damage from or is otherwise harmed by the target, the creature can make another [😈 Resist Enchantment](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#resist-enchantment) check. On a success, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the effect as magical. In addition, each effected creature may make another [😈 Resist Enchantment](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#resist-enchantment) check every 24 hours.

A creature that succeeds a [😈 Resist Enchantment](../game-concepts/ability-scores-and-skills.md#resist-enchantment) check against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

## Lock

_Persistent Terramancy \(Level 2\)_  
**Components** V, S, M \(a silver key\*\)  
**Casting Time** 1 action  
**Range** Touch  
**Duration** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the [DC](../game-concepts/success-and-failure.md#difficulty-class) to break it or pick any locks on it increases by `+10`.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you cast this spell using mana of 3rd level or higher, the DC to break the object or pick any lock on it increases by `+1` per spell level above 2nd.

When you cast this spell using 9th-level mana, it becomes nearly impossible to access the object through mundane means. As long as a key exists, it is impossible to pick the lock. Any attempt to break or force open the object without magic automatically fails. The object becomes immune to all types of damage except `🌟` & `💀`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Ineptitude

When casting this spell without aptitude, there is a 25% chance that you lock yourself out of the object. Roll a `d4`; if the result is 1, you and the creatures you specify cannot open the object normally, and the spell ignores any password you specify.

### Mastery

When casting this spell with mastery, the DC to break the object or pick any locks on it increases by an additional `+5`.
