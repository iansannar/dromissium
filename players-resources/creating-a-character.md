# Creating a Character

## Ability Scores

Ability scores are numeric representations of your character's core strengths and are essential to play the game. An array of ability scores can be generated by rolling `2d4▲-1d4` six times, or you can use this standard array: `+2, +2, +1, +1, ±0, -1`. Once you have six numbers, assign each one to one of the six ability scores in any order.
