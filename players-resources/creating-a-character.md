# Creating a Character

## Ability Scores

Ability scores are numeric representations of your character's core strengths and are essential to play the game. An array of ability scores can be generated by rolling `2d4▲-1d4` six times, or you can use this standard array: `+2, +2, +1, +1, ±0, -1`. Once you have six numbers, assign each one to one of the six ability scores in any order.

### Hit Points

### Training

Training are points that represent the practice and experience you have with either magic or fighting. You have Training equal to three times your level.

Each technique counts 1 towards your Training, and each spell you know counts towards your Training, depending on the spell's [class](../magic/rules-of-magic.md#spell-class): 1 for natural magic, 2 for synthetic magic, 3 for persistent magic, and 4 for true magic.

You may learn new spells and techniques as long as you do not exceed your Training.

You also have a separate Training specifically for Tricks and Simple Techniques equal to twice your level.
