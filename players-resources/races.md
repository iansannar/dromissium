# Races

## Superraces

All races of creatures fall into two categories: aurans \(those "born of the air"\), and terrans \(those "born of the earth"\). Aurans are creatures with an immortal physical essence and a mortal spirit, and terrans are those with mortal bodies but immortal souls. Each have different needs and magical abilities.
