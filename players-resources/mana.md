# Mana

## Breaking Up Mana

Two mana of equal level can be exchanged for three mana of one level lower.

## Mana from Character Level

| Character Level | Mana | Mana Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 5 | 2 | 4 |
| 6 | 3 | 4 |
| 7 | 2 | 5 |
| 8 | 3 | 5 |
| 9 | 1 | 6 |
| 10 | 2 | 6 |
| 11 | 3 | 6 |
| 12 | 1 | 7 |
| 13 | 2 | 7 |
| 14 | 3 | 7 |
| 15 | 1 | 8 |
| 16 | 2 | 8 |
| 17 | 3 | 8 |
| 18 | 1 | 9 |
| 19 | 2 | 9 |
| 20 | 3 | 9 |

## Mana from Presence

A character's [Presence](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) ability score also determines an additional amount of mana that is either gained or lost. A character gains or loses mana equal to their [Presence](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) score of a level determined by the table below:

| Character Level | Mana Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1–5 | 1 |
| 6–10 | 2 |
| 11–15 | 3 |
| 16–20 | 4 |

If a character loses mana due to a negative [Presence](../ability-scores-and-skills.md#presence) score, their mana will need to be [broken up](mana.md#breaking-up-mana) in order to subtract the proper amount of mana.
