# Part 1: Rules

Those who play this game have one of two different roles: a Player Character (or PC), or a Storyteller. The Storyteller acts as a game referee and provides an environment with which the Player Characters may interact, explore, and have adventures in.

## General Assumptions

### Round Down

Whenever you divide a number, round down, regardless how close the fractional value is to the nearest integer.

### Specific Overrides General

Many rules are presented as general assumptions about how the game will proceed, and are contradicted by other rules specific to a situation, spell, ability, etc. In these situations, the specific rule takes priority.

### Storyteller Has The Last Word

While these rules are intended to be followed as written, the Storyteller has the authority to modify or reinterpret any of them. Be careful, though; unfair modifications can drain the fun out of an entire game.

## Dice

The game uses several kinds of polyhedral dice. Sets of these can be found both in game stores as well as online. Computer programs, websites, and other tools can be used in lieu of phsyical dice as well. The following kinds of dice are used:

- The 20-sided die, or **d20**. This is the most commonly used die in the game, used to resolve events, determining success or failure.

- The 12-sided die, or **d12**.

- The 10-sided die, or **d10**. This die works a bit differently. It is numbered 0–9, but a 0 is treated as 10. Numbers between 1 and 100 can be generated using a pair of these, also known as percentile dice, or **d100** (also known as a **d%**). One of the pair is multiplied by ten, and then they are added together, with a 0 being treated as 100. Some d10s are specially marked to be used in this way, displaying multiples of ten on its faces 00–90.

- The 8-sided die, or **d8**.

- The 6-sided die, or **d6**.

- The 4-sided die, or **d4**.

When dice are used, the rules specify how many dice, what kind of dice, and other information. For example, **3d6+7** would mean rolling three six-sided dice, adding their results together, and adding 7 to the total. Sometimes, special symbols will appear to indicate special information about a roll. For example, **2d6<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f525.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">** would indicate 2d6 fire damage, and **2d20<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f53a.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">** would indicate keeping the highest result out of the two twenty-sided dice. Here are all such symbols:

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f53a.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Advantage**: the highest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next highest die.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f53b.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Disadvantage**: the lowest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next lowest die.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/2757.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Exploding**: if the result of a die is the maximum number, (e.g., a result of 6 on a d6), the dice is rerolled and added to the total. This may be repeated as long as the result is the maximum number.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f504.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Reroll**: if the result of a die is the minimum number, (e.g., a result of 1 on a d20), the dice may be rerolled once. The new result must be used. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the minimum range increases by 1 for each symbol (e.g., **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f504.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f504.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f504.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">** permits a reroll with a result of 1–3 on a d20).

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f9ea.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Acid**: indicates acid damage type.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/2744.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Cold**: indicates cold damage type.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f4a2.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Battering**: indicates battering damage type.

- **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/26a1.svg?sanitize=true" width="16"> Electric**: indicates electric damage type.

## Success & Failure

Many situations have a degree of uncertainty, requiring the indifferent randomness of dice to resolve. These are called ability rolls, and use the 20-sided die. Here are the steps to resolving an ability roll:

1. **Roll the dice:** roll the applicable amount of 20-sided dice, determined by the applicable aptitude (see below for rules on aptitude).

2. **Add applicable ability score:** all skill, spells, and weapons are based on one of the six ability scores (see below for rules on ability scores). Find the ability applicable to the roll, and add its score directly to the total.

3. **Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties:** add dominance, threat, and any other bonus or penalty applicable to the roll, such as those created by spells or abilities.

4. **Compare the result to a target number:** rolls are either compared to the result of someone else's roll, or a static number based on general difficulty. See below for the rules for contests, as well as rolls versus fate.

### Contests

Many rolls require the action of one character or object and the reaction of another character or object. These are called contests, and are the most common kind of roll. When a contest is initiated, both the initiator and the reactor make an applicable ability roll, and whoever has the higher result wins. Ties are always broken in favor of the reactor, and the Storyteller may determine that a contest succeeds or fails automatically, if it is reasonable in the situation (e.g., attempting to seduce a killer robot). Below is a table of examples for common contests, and which skills to use for them. Skills are explained in greater detail later in this rulebook.

| Situation     | **Initiator rolls** | Reactor rolls    |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| Attacking     | Applicable weapon   | Evade            |
| Grappling     | Wrestle             | Resist Restraint |
| Pickpocketing | Steal               | Notice           |
| Haggling      | Persuade            | Judge            |

### Versus Fate

Sometimes, a roll must be made but a contest is not appropriate. Such situations include lifting a heavy box, resisting the harmful effects of a poisoned drink, or tying an effective knot in a stressful situation, etc. These situations are called contests versus fate, and rather than fate rolling, the result is a fixed number determined by the difficulty of the situation, called "the will of fate". Ties are always broken in favor of fate. If the will of fate is greater than the highest number the other party can possibly roll, fate wins the contest immediately without a roll. Below is a reference table for the will of fate. 

| Difficulty        | Fate result | Examples                                |
| ----------------- |:-----------:| --------------------------------------- |
| Trivial           | 5–9         | Noticing something in plain sight       |
| Easy              | 10–14       | Finding a specific book in a library    |
| Moderate          | 15–19       | Breaking down a locked wooden door      |
| Hard              | 20–24       | Deciphering an encrypted message        |
| Punishing         | 25–29       | Free-climbing a cliff in a thunderstorm |
| Nearly impossible | 30+         | Inventing a new practice of magic       |

### Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's proficiency and skill. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Ability rolls without aptitude are **2d20 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f53b.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">**. Ability rolls with aptitude are the normal **1d20**. On character sheets, a lack of aptitude is denoted by **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/26aa.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">** next to the applicable item, and aptitude is denoted by **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/26ab.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">**.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the most common exceptions:

- **Armor:** light, medium, and heavy armor cannot be worn without aptitude of their respective kinds.

- **Language:** a language cannot be read, written, or spoken without aptitude in that language.

#### Mastery

Sometimes a character has expert command over a certain skill or weapon. This is represented by expertise; an upgrade from aptitude. Ability rolls with expertise are **2d20 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f53a.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">**. On character sheets, mastery is denoted by **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/2b50.svg?sanitize=true" width="16">** next to the applicable item.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the most common exceptions:

- **Armor:** mastery with light, medium, or heavy armor allows the disregard of any prerequesites, such as a minimum Strength score, etc.

- **Language:** mastery is not applicable to languages.

### Triumph & Disaster

`TODO: explain natural 1s and 20s. If both get a crit success or fail they cancel out`

### Dominance & Threat

Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelyhood of success, such attempting to enter a guarded castle while having a good reputation or trying to barter prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Dominance adds a bonus d6 to a roll, relfecting a positive circumstance, while threat is the opposite: a penalty d6 that is subtracted from a roll. If you have both dominance and threat, they cancel out—however, both dominance and threat stack. Trying to hit a target while being blind, drunk, and set on fire, but having a magic target-seeking arrow might warrant three threats and one dominance, ultimately resulting in just two threats applied to the roll.

## Ability Scores & Skills
Skills are divided into two categories: active skills and reactive skills. Active skills, such as Craft Item and Treat Wound, are employed when "actively" attempting a task, where reactive skills, such as Evade and Judge, are used to "react" to the actions of others through contests. All skills fall under one of the six ability scores: Strength, Agility, Vitality, Erudition, Intuition, and Presence. All skills are listed below, according to their ability score and whether they are active or reactive.
