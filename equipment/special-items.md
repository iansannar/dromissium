### ðŸŸ£ Vorpal \(weapon modifier\)

When you score a critical hit with this weapon against a creature , you deal an extra amount of wounding damage to it equal to 1d4 Ã— the creature's level. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its head is severed. If the creature can't live without the lost head, it immediately dies.
