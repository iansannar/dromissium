### ðŸŸ§ Dromissium Ceramic Armor

Dromissium is a priceless substance capable of converting physical energy into magical energy. This property makes it incredibly useful for armor. Coating thin ceramic plate armor with a minuscule layer of dromissium allows for armor that insulates both heat and electricity while also absorbing physical shockâ€”all while converting a portion of that damage into magical energy.

Whenever a creature wearing dromissium ceramic armor takes an amount of damage greater than the soak provided by that armor, they gain extra mana of a level equal to the mana they would [gain or lose from their presence](../playing-the-game/creating-a-character/#mana-from-presence) score. A creature cannot have more than one mana from dromissium ceramic armor at a time.

Dromissium ceramic armor is considered heavy armor.
