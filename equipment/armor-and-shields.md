# Armor & Shields

Armor and shields serve as a protection against different kinds of damage by providing defense and soak. Read about defense and soak [here](../reference/damage-and-healing.md#defense-and-soak).

## Armor

Some armor provides an amount of defense or soak that scales with a character's level. `L` is equal to your level, and `l` is equal to your level divided by two \(rounded down\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Incompetence

When wearing a kind of armor you lack aptitude with, you suffer threat on all Resist Restraint, Evade, and Stealth checks.

### Mastery

When wearing a kind of armor you have mastery with, you may ignore any minimum Strength ability score requirement.

## Shields

Shields can also provide defense and soak, but unlike armor, they must be actively used in order to be effective. When a creature you can see damages you with a spell or attack, you can use your reaction to apply the shield's defense and soak against that damage.

Shields provide an amount of defense or soak that scales with a character's level. `L` is equal to your level, and `l` is equal to your level divided by two \(rounded down\).

### Incompetence

When using shields without aptitude, you must first succeed a difficulty 10 Evasion check or the shield has no effect.

### Mastery

When using shields with mastery, you may ignore any minimum Strength ability score requirement.
