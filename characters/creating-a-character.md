# Creating a Character

## Assign Ability Scores

Each character must have numbers assigned to each of their four ability scores. You can assign each number in the following list to each of your character's ability scores, in any order: +1, ±0, ±0, -1.

## Choose a Race

## Choose an Origin

## Starting Inventory

## Level 1 & Beyond

Each character has a level, which represents that character's experience and power. Each time a character advances a level, including level 1, that character gains new abilities and grows stronger.

There are two main ways to determine the abilities a character gains when they level up: classes or customized. Classes are a preset list of which abilities to take in order to build a certain character archetype \(such as a barbarian, druid, or wizard\), and a customized character requires more work and strategy but allows complete control over which abilities a character obtains. Both methods provide tables that show which abilities are available at each level.

### Training

Training are points you gain as a character levels up that represent the time and effort they invest into learning or improving their abilities. gambits, spells, and tricks can be learned by spending training. Each gambit costs 1 training to learn or increase proficiency with, and spells and tricks cost an amount depending on their magic class: 1 training for natural or synthetic magic, and 2 for persistent or true magic.
