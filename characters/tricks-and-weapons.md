### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use. These properties are listed for each weapon.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make an attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition determines the damage type of the attack, and special ammunition may also provide additional effects. Ammunition is destroyed upon use.

#### Melee

You can target creatures within this weapon's reach when attacking with this weapon. The reach is specified in parentheses next to the melee property.

#### Ranged

You can target creatures within this weapon's range when attacking with this weapon. The range is specified in parentheses next to the ranged property. You can also target creatures beyond this weapon's range, but do so with threat.

#### Reload

A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. You must then reload it using an action or bonus action. The number of shots is listed in parentheses next to the reload property.
