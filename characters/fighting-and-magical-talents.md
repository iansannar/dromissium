# Fighting & Magical Talents

## Fighting Talents

### Risky Attack

When you make an attack with a weapon, you may take a -1 penalty to the attack roll. If you hit, you gain a +2 bonus instead.

### Opportunist

When you make an attack with dominance, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll.

## Magical Talents

### Arcane Recovery

Once per long rest, you may regain one expended mana.

### Subtle Casting

You can ignore the requirement for either somatic or verbal components when casting a spell, but not both at the same time.
