# Race

## Racial Traits

Each character has a race, which defines their natural, inborn characteristics. The benefits gained from these characteristics are called racial traits. The following racial traits are present in each race. A short description explains what they mean:

### Constitution

Constitution represents the recovery capabilities of a creature. Constitution is a type of dice, usually a d8, d10, or d12. These dice affect how many hit points can be recovered when resting, as well as the potential amount of maximum hit points gained when leveling up. Each player has a maximum amount of constitution dice equal to their level.

Each race defines which type of dice it uses for constitution.

### Senses

Each race sees the world in some way, whether it is by light, by sound, or by magic. Each race will list what senses they have and their ranges. ~~Read about the different kinds of senses here.~~

### Walk, Climb, & Swim Speeds

Each creature has a walking speed, a climbing speed, and a swimming speed. These speeds represent how fast a creature can move across different kinds of terrain both while traveling and during encounters. Some creatures may have a flying speed as well, though this is more rare.

A creature's base movement speed is equal to 5 Ã— their Strength score, but a creature's race provides different bonuses that are added to each different kind of movement speed.

### Ability Score Increase

All races are different, and many of them have natural advantages or disadvantages compared to others. Each race will specify which ability scores to increase, and by how much.

### Other **Racial** Traits

Races usually have additional traits. These are listed below the rest of the traits with a thorough description of what they do.

## Rarity <a id="rarity"></a>

* âšª Common. No restrictions.
