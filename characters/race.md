# Race

## Racial Traits

Each character has a race, which defines their natural, inborn characteristics. The benefits gained from these characteristics are called racial traits. The following racial traits are present in each race. A short description explains what they mean:

### Senses

Each race sees the world in some way, whether it is by light, by sound, or by magic. Each race will list what senses they have and their ranges. Read about the different kinds of senses [here](../reference/senses.md).

### Walk, Climb, & Swim Speeds

Each creature has a walking speed, a climbing speed, and a swimming speed. These speeds represent how fast a creature can move across different kinds of terrain both while traveling and during encounters. Some creatures may have a flying speed as well, though this is more rare.

### Ability Score Increase

All races are different, and many of them have natural advantages or disadvantages compared to others. Each race will specify which ability scores to increase, and by how much.

### Other **Racial** Traits

Races usually have additional traits. These are listed below the rest of the traits with a thorough description of what they do.

## Rarity <a id="rarity"></a>

Not all races are found everywhere, and as such not all races are suited for all settings. Each race has a rarity, which might restrict its availability. Racial rarities are listed below:

* âšª Common. No restrictions.
* ðŸŸ¢ Uncommon. No restrictions. Try to avoid having more than one or two of this race in a group at a time.
* ðŸ”µ Rare. Ask your Storyteller before creating a character with this race. They will probably say yes.
* ðŸŸ£ Exotic. Ask your Storyteller before creating a character with this race. In addition, try to avoid having more than one of this race in a group at a time.
* ðŸŸ  Prime. These races are incredibly rare or powerful. They may be played only if the chance is offered by the Storyteller.
* ðŸ”´ Unique. Player-made races have this rarity. Before making a race, obtain the Storyteller's permission to make a custom race, and have them review and approve your custom race before using it.
