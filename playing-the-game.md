# Playing the Game

## Traveling

A group can travel by foot for up to 6 hours each day at one of the following paces:

| Pace | Speed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hasty | 6 miles per hour | Threat on Perception and Stealth checks |
| Normal | 4 miles per hour | Threat on Stealth checks |
| Cautious | 2 miles per hour | â€” |

### Difficult Terrain

Not all travel is through flat or solid ground. When traveling through more hazardous terrain such as a swamp, mountains, or rain forest, the speed of traveling is halved.

### Travel by Flight

If a group of characters all have a flying speed, an additional travel pace becomes available to them. A group can only travel at this pace for 1 hour each day.

| Pace | Speed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Flying | 25 miles per hour | Automatically fail Stealth checks; threat on Perception checks |

### Forced March

A group of characters can travel for more than 6 hours in a day, but at the risk of straining themselves. At the beginning of each hour traveled past 6, each member of the group must succeed a Resist Exhaustion check or become Exhausted. The difficulty of this check is equal to 10 + 1 for each hour traveled past 6.

## Resting

### Long Rest

A **long rest** occurs after 8 hours of sleep and a meal. At the end of a long rest, a creature can spend constitution dice to regain hit points, after which it regains up to half of its spent constitution dice.

If a creature goes 24 hours without a long rest, it must succeed a difficulty 20 Resist Exhaustion check or become Exhausted.

### Short Rest

A **short rest** occurs after 4 hours of light activity or rest and a drink. At the end of a short rest, a creature can spend constitution dice to regain hit points,

If a creature goes three days without a short rest, it must succeed a difficulty 20 Resist Exhaustion check or become Exhausted.

## Encounters

When a situation arises where every second counts, an **encounter** begins. Common examples of encounters are combat and chases.
