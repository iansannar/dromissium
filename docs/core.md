# Overview

Those who play this game have one of two different roles: a Player Character (or PC), or a Storyteller. The Storyteller acts as a game referee and provides an environment with which the Player Characters may interact, explore, and have adventures in.

# General Assumptions

Here are some general rules that apply to the entire game:

- **Round Down.** Whenever you divide a number, round down, regardless how close the fractional value is to the nearest integer.

- **Specific Overrides General.** Many rules are presented as general assumptions about how the game will proceed, and are contradicted by other rules specific to a situation, spell, ability, etc. In these situations, the specific rule takes priority.

- **Storyteller Has The Last Word.** While these rules are intended to be followed as written, the Storyteller has the authority to modify or reinterpret any of them. Be careful, though; unfair modifications can drain the fun out of an entire game.

# Dice

The game uses several kinds of polyhedral dice. Sets of these can be found both in game stores as well as online. Computer programs, websites, and other tools can be used in lieu of physical dice as well. The following kinds of dice are used:

- The 20-sided die, or **d20**. This is the most commonly used die in the game, used to resolve events, determining success or failure.

- The 12-sided die, or **d12**.

- The 10-sided die, or **d10**. This die works a bit differently. It is numbered 0–9, but a 0 is treated as 10. Numbers between 1 and 100 can be generated using a pair of these, also known as percentile dice, or **d100** (also known as a **d%**). One of the pair is multiplied by ten, and then they are added together, with a 0 being treated as 100. Some d10s are specially marked to be used in this way, displaying multiples of ten on its faces 00–90.

- The 8-sided die, or **d8**.

- The 6-sided die, or **d6**.

- The 4-sided die, or **d4**.

When dice are used, the rules specify how many dice, what kind of dice, and other information. For example, **3d6+7** would mean rolling three six-sided dice, adding their results together, and adding 7 to the total. Sometimes, special symbols will appear to indicate special information about a roll. For example, **2d6<img src="assets/symbols/fire.svg" class="emoji">** would indicate 2d6 fire damage, and **2d20<img src="assets/symbols/up.svg" class="emoji">** would indicate keeping the highest result out of the two twenty-sided dice. Here are all such symbols:

- **<img src="assets/symbols/up.svg" class="emoji"> Advantage**: the highest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next highest die.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/down.svg" class="emoji"> Disadvantage**: the lowest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next lowest die.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/bang.svg" class="emoji"> Exploding**: if the result of a die is the maximum number, (e.g., a result of 6 on a d6), the dice is rerolled and added to the total. This may be repeated as long as the result is the maximum number.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/repeat.svg" class="emoji"> Reroll**: if the result of a die is the minimum number, (e.g., a result of 1 on a d20), the dice may be rerolled once. The new result must be used. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the minimum range increases by 1 for each symbol (e.g., **<img src="assets/symbols/repeat.svg" class="emoji"><img src="assets/symbols/repeat.svg" class="emoji"><img src="assets/symbols/repeat.svg" class="emoji">** permits a reroll with a result of 1–3 on a d20).

- **<img src="assets/symbols/vial.svg" class="emoji"> Acid**: indicates acid damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/snowflake.svg" class="emoji"> Cold**: indicates cold damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/impact.svg" class="emoji"> Battering**: indicates battering damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/electricity.svg" class="emoji"> Electric**: indicates electric damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/fire.svg" class="emoji"> Fire**: indicates fire damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/brain.svg" class="emoji"> Psychic**: indicates psychic damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/shine.svg" class="emoji"> Radiant**: indicates radiant damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/biohazard.svg" class="emoji"> Toxic**: indicates toxic damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/bones.svg" class="emoji"> Withering**: indicates withering damage type.

- **<img src="assets/symbols/blood.svg" class="emoji"> Wounding**: indicates wounding damage type.

# Success & Failure

Many situations have a degree of uncertainty, requiring the indifferent randomness of dice to resolve. These are called ability rolls, and use the 20-sided die. Here are the steps to resolving an ability roll:

1. **Roll the dice:** roll the applicable amount of 20-sided dice, determined by the applicable aptitude (see below for rules on aptitude).

2. **Add applicable ability score:** all rolls are based on one of the six ability scores (see below for rules on ability scores). Find the ability applicable to the roll, and add its score directly to the total.

3. **Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties:** add dominance, threat, and any other bonus or penalty applicable to the roll, such as those created by spells or abilities.

4. **Compare the result to a target number:** rolls are either compared to the result of someone else's roll, or a static number based on general difficulty. See below for the rules for contests, as well as rolls versus fate.

## Contests

Many rolls require the action of one character or object and the reaction of another character or object. These are called contests, and are the most common kind of roll. When a contest is initiated, both the initiator and the reactor make an applicable ability roll, and whoever has the higher result wins. Ties are always broken in favor of the reactor, and the Storyteller may determine that a contest is not possible at all, if it is reasonable in the situation (e.g., attempting to seduce a killer robot). Below is a table of examples for common contests, and which skills to use for them. Skills are explained in greater detail later in this rulebook.

| Situation     | **Initiator rolls** | Reactor rolls    |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| Attacking     | Applicable weapon   | Evade            |
| Grappling     | Wrestle             | Resist Restraint |
| Pickpocketing | Steal               | Notice           |
| Haggling      | Persuade            | Judge            |

## Versus Fate

Sometimes, a roll must be made but a contest is not appropriate. Such situations include lifting a heavy box, resisting the harmful effects of a poisoned drink, or tying an effective knot in a stressful situation, etc. These situations are called contests versus fate, and rather than fate rolling, the result is a fixed number determined by the difficulty of the situation, called "the will of fate". Ties are always broken in favor of fate. If the will of fate is greater than the highest number the other party can possibly roll, fate wins the contest immediately without a roll. Below is a reference table for the will of fate.

| Difficulty        | Will of Fate | Examples                                |
| ----------------- |:-----------:| --------------------------------------- |
| Trivial           | 5–9         | Noticing something in plain sight       |
| Easy              | 10–14       | Finding a specific book in a library    |
| Moderate          | 15–19       | Breaking down a locked wooden door      |
| Hard              | 20–24       | Deciphering an encrypted message        |
| Punishing         | 25–29       | Free-climbing a cliff in a thunderstorm |
| Nearly impossible | 30+         | Inventing a new practice of magic       |

## Aptitude

Aptitude is a reflection of a character's proficiency and skill. A character can have aptitudes for a variety of things, including skills, equipment, weapons, and even spells. Ability rolls without aptitude are **2d20<img src="assets/symbols/down.svg" class="emoji">**. Ability rolls with aptitude are the normal **1d20**. On character sheets, aptitude is denoted by **<img src="assets/symbols/circle.svg" class="emoji">** next to the applicable item.

Not all aptitudes are applicable to rolls. Here are the most common exceptions:

- **Armor:** light, medium, and heavy armor cannot be worn without aptitude of their respective kinds.

- **Language:** a language cannot be read, written, or spoken without aptitude in that language.

- **Magic:** some spells and tricks might specify special rules for how to handle aptitude with it.

### Mastery

Sometimes a character has expert command over a certain skill or weapon. This is represented by expertise; an upgrade from aptitude. Ability rolls with expertise are **2d20<img src="assets/symbols/up.svg" class="emoji">**. On character sheets, mastery is denoted by **<img src="assets/symbols/star.svg" class="emoji">** next to the applicable item.

Not all mastery is applicable to rolls. Here are the most common exceptions:

- **Armor:** mastery with light, medium, or heavy armor allows the disregard of any prerequisites, such as a minimum Strength score, etc.

- **Language:** mastery is not applicable to languages.

- **Magic:** some spells and tricks might specify special rules for how to handle mastery with it.

## Triumph & Disaster

When making an ability roll, the d20 may produce a 1 or a 20. These fairly rare rolls trigger triumph and disaster, reflecting the extremes of both good and bad luck.

In a contest, if both parties get triumph or disaster, they cancel out and are ignored. If one party gets triumph and another gets disaster, both apply.

### Disaster

If the natural (or unmodified) result of the roll is 1, this triggers disaster. Regardless of what the result would normally be, the ability roll fails. The Storyteller should also impose additional negative effects as part of disaster.

> [!NOTE]
Some rare effects may increase the possibility of disaster by increasing the amount of natural numbers that trigger it. These effects will specify the range, such as "1–3".

### Triumph

If the natural result of the roll is 20, this triggers triumph. Regardless of what the result would normally be, the ability roll succeeds. The Storyteller should also impose additional positive effects as part of triumph. Triumph on an attack roll causes a critical hit.

> [!NOTE]
Some rare effects may increase the possibility of triumph by increasing the amount of natural numbers that trigger it. These effects will specify the range, such as "18–20".

> [!DANGER]
Triumph guarantees success. The Storyteller should be cautious and disallow ability rolls for impossible tasks, such as lifting a castle or lying to a god.

## Dominance & Threat

Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelihood of success, such attempting to enter a guarded castle while having a good reputation or trying to barter prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Dominance adds a bonus d6 to a roll, reflecting a positive circumstance, while threat is the opposite: a penalty d6 that is subtracted from a roll. If you have both dominance and threat, they cancel out—however, both dominance and threat stack. Trying to hit a target while being blind, drunk, and set on fire, but having a magic target-seeking arrow might warrant three threats and one dominance, ultimately resulting in just two threats applied to the roll.

# Ability Scores & Skills

Ability Scores are numeric values that represent the core capabilities of a creature. Base ability scores for a new character can be generated with **2d4<img src="assets/symbols/up.svg" class="emoji"> - 1d4**.

Skills are divided into two categories: active skills and reactive skills. Active skills, such as Craft Item and Treat Wound, are employed when "actively" attempting a task, where reactive skills, such as Evade and Judge, are used to "react" to the actions of others through contests. All skills fall under one of the six ability scores: Strength, Agility, Vitality, Erudition, Intuition, and Presence. All skills are listed below, according to their ability score and whether they are active or reactive.

# Adventuring

# Encounters

When a situation arises where every second counts, an encounter begins. Examples of encounters could be combat, a chase, or escaping a collapsing cave. Encounters provide a sense of urgency and rules to back it up.

## Initiative

Once an encounter begins, everyone must roll initiative. Initiative is a temporary score that determines in what order everyone takes their turns. Based purely on luck, initiative rolls are made with 1d100. If a tie occurs, the two parties participate in a Reason contest, with the winner going first.

## Rounds & Turns

Encounters are fast-paced and chaotic. In order to manage this, time is divided into rounds and turns. A round represents about 5–10 seconds of in-game time. Within each round, each participant takes their turn. Turns are taken in order of highest to lowest initiative. When everybody has taken their turn, the next round begins, and the cycle begins again.

This organization of time continues until the Storyteller decides that the encounter has ended.

## Surprise

Certain circumstances may leave one side of an encounter surprised. If the Storyteller determines that an individual or group are surprised, they do not gain any stamina on their first turn (explained below).

## Stamina

Stamina represents how much a creature is physically capable of accomplishing within the course of a round. Each creature has a maximum stamina of 5 + Vitality.

Different things cost stamina during a round. Many actions taken during a turn require stamina, but it can also be used to react to things that happen during others' turns. Stamina is replenished completely at the beginning of a turn.

## Movement

Each turn, each participant in an encounter can move up to an amount equal to their speed (use walking, swimming, or flying speed as applicable). If multiple kinds of movement are used during a turn, the total amount traveled must be less than or equal to the greatest speed used. Movement does not have to be continuous, and can be broken up between other actions during a turn.

You can move through space occupied by another creature, but you cannot end your movement in a space occupied by another creature. In addition, spaces occupied by hostile creatures count as difficult terrain.

### Difficult Terrain

Some terrain is more difficult to move through than others. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. Some kinds of difficult terrain may be ignored by certain speeds, such as flying over briars or swimming through water rather than walking. The Storyteller decides what kinds of terrain are difficult, and what movement types are affected.

### Being Prone

While the prone status effect can describe different kinds of disadvantageous stances, it is most commonly used to describe being knocked down. Standing up to remove this status effect during an encounter costs an amount of movement equal to half your walk speed.

## Holding a Turn

Any participant in an encounter may choose to reduce their initiative score to a minimum of 0 for the rest of the round. This decision must be declared before their turn is taken, and their original initiative score is restored at the end of their turn.

## Actions

Each turn, each participant in an encounter may choose to expend stamina to accomplish a variety of actions. Below is a list of common actions, but the Storyteller may approve additional or even improvised actions as well.

### Attack
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 2+

Attacks come in many forms and require different amounts of stamina, but they all follow these steps:

**1. Choose Target(s).** The weapon or attack used will specify what it can target, how many targets, and the range of the attack. Select target(s) accordingly.

**2. Make a Contest.** Make a contest of Attack v. Evade. Unlike other skills, Attack is specific to each weapon, and your aptitude or mastery comes from aptitude or mastery with the weapon being used in the attack. In addition, Attack is an Agility-based roll, so Agility gets added to the result of the roll. If the result of the Attack roll is greater than the result of the Evade roll, the attack hits. Otherwise, it misses.

**3. Roll Damage.** If the attack hits, the weapon or attack used will specify how much damage it inflicts, typically with dice. After rolling the damage dice, add Strength to the total to find the resulting damage.

### Cast Magic
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 2+

Spells and tricks can be wildly different from each other. A spell or trick will determine how to use it, as well as its stamina cost.

### Climb onto a Bigger Creature
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

Make a contest of Wrestle v. Wrestle against a creature at least one size larger than you within 5 feet. If you succeed, you may treat space occupied by the target as difficult terrain, you move with the creature when it moves, and you gain dominance on Attack rolls against that creature.

### Dash
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

Move up to an extra amount equal to your speed, as described in the Movement section above.

### Disarm
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or item from another creature's grasp.

**1. Choose Target(s).** The weapon or attack used will specify what it can target, how many targets, and the range of the attack. Select target(s) accordingly.

**2. Make a Contest.** Make a contest of Attack v. Evade. Gain one dominance (or threat) for every size difference between you and the target. Gain one threat if the target is holding the item with two hands. Unlike other skills, Attack is specific to each weapon, and your aptitude or mastery comes from aptitude or mastery with the weapon being used in the attack. Unlike normal attacks, the Disarm action is a Strength-based roll, so Strength gets added to the result of the roll. If the result of the Attack roll is greater than the result of the Evade roll, the target drops whatever they are holding. Otherwise, nothing happens.

### Disengage
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

Your movement cannot trigger Opportunity Attacks until the beginning of your next turn.

### Dodge
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

Gain dominance on all Evade rolls until the beginning of your next turn.

### Grapple
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

Make a contest of Wrestle v. Wrestle against a creature within 5 feet of you. Gain one dominance (or threat) for every size difference between you and the target. If you succeed, the target is restrained and you are prone (see the status effects).

### Help
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

When taking the Help action, specify a creature and a task. You must be able to perform the task on your own and contribute effort in a reasonable fashion in order to take the Help action. The specified creature gains dominance on the next ability roll to perform the specified task before the beginning of your next turn.

### Hide
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

### Search
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

When taking the Search action, you focus your efforts on finding something. The Storyteller may require a Notice or Inspect ability roll in order for this to be successful, if finding the subject is possible at all.

### Shove
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 3

### Switch Weapons
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 1–2, depending on if one or both hands are required

Change which weapon you are currently using.

### Use an Object
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 1+

Items and objects can be wildly different from each other. An item or object will determine how to use it, as well as its stamina cost. Some objects are improvised or environmental. The Storyteller will determine the requirements and stamina cost for these situations.

## Reactions

Some situations allow a creature to react to events outside their turn. All reactions cost stamina and must be triggered by events specified by the reaction. Below is a list of common reactions, but the Storyteller may approve additional or even improvised reactions as well.

### Opportunity Attack
> [!NOTE]
Stamina cost: 2+;
Trigger: hostile creature you can see moves beyond reach of melee weapon currently held

Make an attack as described in the Attack action above against the creature that triggered this reaction. The attack takes place as they leave the reach of the currently held melee weapon, so the hostile creature is considered within range.

# Status Effects

Status effects can be either boosts or impairments, affecting a creature’s capabilities for better or worse.

A status effect lasts either until it is removed or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the status effect. Status effects may come with their own rules on how they can be removed.

Some status effects can be gained multiple times, while others can not. If a status effect does not specify otherwise and it is gained more than once, each instance of the status effect has its own duration but the effect is only applied once.

## Angry

The angry status represents extreme frustration or hatred that clouds one’s thinking.

-  An angry creature suffers threat on all Intuition-based ability rolls.

>[!NOTE]
The angry status can be gained more than once.

## Blinded

The blinded status represents temporary or permanent impairment to a sense. When a creature becomes blinded, the imposing effect may specify which sense it blinds (tremorsense, blindsense, sphynxvision, truevision), but if it does not, it is referring to vision & darkvision.

-  A blinded creature automatically fails all ability rolls that require the blinded sense. Blinded creatures also suffer threat on attack and evade rolls.
-  A creature who has more than one applicable sense may ignore the effects of being blinded.

>[!NOTE]
The blinded status can be gained more than once, but only if a different sense is blinded each time.

## Crippled

The crippled status represents severe physical impairment not representable through damage.

-  A crippled creature suffers disaster on all Strength, Agility, and Vitality-based ability rolls on a natural result of 1–2.

>[!NOTE]
The crippled status can be gained more than once. If a creature has more than one level of crippled, the range for disaster increases by 1 for each level (e.g. 4 levels of crippled triggers disaster on a natural result of 1–5).

## Deafened

The deafened status represents temporary or permanent impairment to hearing.

-  A deafened creature automatically fails all ability rolls that require hearing.

## Exhausted

The exhausted status represents severe fatigue and strain not representable through damage.

-  An exhausted creature suffers threat on all ability rolls.

>[!NOTE]
The exhausted status can be gained more than once.

## Frightened

The frightened status represents overwhelming terror.

-  A frightened creature cannot willingly move closer to the source or cause of the status effect.
-  A frightened creature suffers threat on initiative rolls.

## Paralyzed

The paralyzed status represents an inability to move.

-  A paralyzed creature cannot move, speak, or regain stamina.
-  A paralyzed creature automatically fails evade rolls unless the attacker rolls disaster.

## Petrified

The petrified status represents being transformed into a rigid material.

-  A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance. While in this state, the creature is immune to toxic damage and cannot gain any other status effects. Any alterations to this rigid form remain after the petrified status is removed.
-  A petrified creature cannot move, speak, or regain stamina.
-  A petrified creature automatically fails evade rolls unless the attacker rolls disaster.

>[!NOTE]
The petrified status can be gained up to twice. If a creature has more than one level of the petrified status, it becomes unconscious (see the status effect) until the petrified status ends.

## Poisoned

The poisoned status represents physical, mental, or emotional impairment due to a toxic substance.

-  A poisoned creature suffers threat on ability rolls depending on the source imposing the status. Below is a table of common poisons and which ability rolls they impose threat on.

-  Some poisons and the poisoned status they impose can be cured by an applicable antidote. The Storyteller decides the availability of antidotes.

| **Poison**    | **Affected Ability Rolls**              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Alcohol       | Evade, Resist Exhaustion, Judge, Notice |
| Serpent venom | Resist Restraint, Resist Death          |
| Truth serum   | Reason, Judge                           |

>[!NOTE]
The poisoned status can be gained more than once, but only if each poison is different.

## Prone

The prone status represents a disadvantageous physical position or stance, usually being knocked down.

-  A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl. Every foot of movement in this way costs 1 extra foot.
-  A prone creature can end the prone status effect by standing up, at the cost of half their movement.
-  A prone creature suffers threat on attack and evade ability rolls.

## Restrained

The restrained status represents being limited or otherwise bound, being unable to move.

-  A restrained creature’s movement speed becomes 0.
-  A restrained creature suffers threat on attack and evade ability rolls.

## Sick

The sick status represents a physical disorder, such as an infection or illness.

-  A sick creature’s movement speed is halved.
-  A sick creature suffers threat on all Vitality-based ability rolls.

>[!NOTE]
The sick status can be gained more than once. If a creature has more than one level of the sick status, its speed is not reduced by more than half.

## Stunned

The stunned status represents being staggered or in shock.

-  A stunned creature can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
-  A stunned creature automatically fails Strength and Agility-based ability rolls.

## Unconscious

The unconscious status represents total mental shutdown, as if asleep.

-  An unconscious creature can’t move, speak, or regain stamina.
-  An unconscious creature is not aware of its surroundings.
-  An unconscious creature automatically fails Strength and Agility-based ability rolls.
-  When a creature becomes unconscious, it drops whatever it is holding and falls to the ground, becoming prone (see the status effect).
