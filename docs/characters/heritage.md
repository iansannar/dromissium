## Inherited Traits

Each character has a heritage, which influences their natural, inborn characteristics. The benefits gained from these characteristics are called Inherited Traits. The following Inherited Traits are present in each heritage. A short description explains what they mean:

### Senses

All creatures see the world in some way, whether it is by light, by sound, or by magic. Each heritage will list what senses they have and their ranges. Read about the different kinds of senses [here](../reference/senses.md).

### Walk, Climb, & Swim Speeds

Each creature has a walking speed, a climbing speed, and a swimming speed. These speeds represent how fast a creature can move across different kinds of terrain both while traveling and during encounters. Some creatures may have a flying speed as well, though this is more rare.

### Ability Score Increase

Creatures of certain heritages have natural advantages or disadvantages compared to others. Each heritage will specify which ability scores to increase, and by how much.

### Other Inherited Traits

Creatures usually have additional traits, dependent on their heritage. These are listed below the rest of the traits with a thorough description of what they do.

## Rarity

Not all heritages are suited for all settings. Each heritage has a rarity, which might restrict its availability. Heritage rarities are listed below:

* <mark class="rarity-common">Common</mark>: No restrictions. 
* <mark class="rarity-uncommon">Uncommon</mark>: No restrictions. Try to avoid having more than one or two characters with this heritage in a group at a time.
* <mark class="rarity-rare">Rare</mark>: Ask your Storyteller before creating a character with this heritage. They will probably say yes.
* <mark class="rarity-precious">Precious</mark>: Ask your Storyteller before creating a character with this heritage. In addition, try to avoid having more than one character with this heritage in a group at a time.
* <mark class="rarity-prime">Prime</mark>: These heritages are incredibly rare or grant powerful traits. They may be played only if the chance is offered by the Storyteller.
* <mark class="rarity-unique">Unique</mark>: Player-made heritages have this rarity. Before making a heritage, obtain the Storyteller's permission to make a custom heritage, and have them review and approve your custom heritage before using it.
