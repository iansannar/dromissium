# Success & Failure

## Dice

The game uses several kinds of polyhedral dice. Sets of these can be found both in game stores as well as online. Computer programs, websites, and other tools can be used in lieu of physical dice as well. The following kinds of dice are used:

* The 20-sided die, or **d20**. This is the most commonly used die in the game, used to resolve events, determining success or failure.
* The 12-sided die, or **d12**.
* The 10-sided die, or **d10**. This die works a bit differently: It is numbered 0–9, but a 0 is treated as 10. Numbers between 1 and 100 can be generated using a pair of these, also known as percentile dice, or **d100**. One of the pair is multiplied by ten, and then they are added together, with a 0 being treated as 100. Some d10s are specially marked to be used in this way, displaying multiples of ten on its faces 00–90.
* The 8-sided die, or **d8**.
* The 6-sided die, or **d6**.
* The 4-sided die, or **d4**.

When dice are used, the rules specify how many dice, what kind of dice, and other information. For example, `3d6+7` would mean rolling three six-sided dice, adding their results together, and adding 7 to the total. Sometimes, special symbols will appear to indicate special information about a roll. For example, `2d20▲` ****would indicate keeping the highest result out of the two twenty-sided dice. Here are all such symbols:

* `▲` **Advantage:** the highest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next highest die.
* `▼` **Disadvantage:** the lowest result out of the group of dice is kept, and the other dice are ignored. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the number of dice kept increases by 1 for each symbol, keeping the next lowest die.
* `!` **Exploding:** if the result of a die is the maximum number, \(e.g., a result of 6 on a d6\), the dice is rerolled and added to the total. This process may be repeated as long as the result is the maximum number.
* `♻` **Reroll:** if the result of a die is the minimum number, \(e.g., a result of 1 on a d20\), the dice may be rerolled once. The new result must be used. If the symbol is repeated more than once, the minimum range increases by 1 for each symbol \(e.g., `1d20♻♻♻` permits a reroll with a result of 1–3 on a d20\).
